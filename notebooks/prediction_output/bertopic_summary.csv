yes reading comments yes still read comments source joy strict moderation much takes away focused mind little least think takes away fun need focus fun enjoy thing subscribe youtube review apple podcast follow spotify support patreon connect twitter lex friedman figure spell conversation cal newport deep work let start big question mean term focusing without distraction cognitively demanding task something done never really given name necessarily separate type work gave name said let compare types efforts might working see deep work efforts actually huge benefit might underestimating mean work deeply something calling hard focus writing well context would understand theory group csail mit right surrounded time coming ideas professional theoreticians like murderer row thinkers right mean like turing award turing award macarthur turing award mean know crew right theoretical computer science theoretical computer science yeah yeah theory group right theoretical computer science publish book milieu exposed people focus tier one skill like would talk right like intensely focus key skill like time something athlete right something people actually theory folks start thinking oh yeah really oh yeah like openly discussing focus mean know would quantify focus tier one skill would come typical day come eric demaine would sitting front whiteboard right whole group visitors come work maybe projected like grid working graph theory problem go lunch go gym come back sitting staring whiteboard right like tier one skill difference different disciplines like often feel many reasons like fraud definitely feel like fraud hang like either mathematicians physicists like feels like legit work talk closer computer science get programming like machine learning like experimental machine learning like engineering version feels like gone far away required solve something fundamental universe feels like like cheating way like kind trick figure solve problem one particular case feels interested hear think programming always feel like need think deeply work deeply sometimes weird dance sure code right mean especially coming original algorithmic designs think great example deep work mean yeah hardcore theoreticians push extreme mean think like knowing athletic endeavor good hanging olympic athlete like oh see grad students like anywhere near level faculty group cognitive olympic athletes coding think classic example deep work got problem wan na solve tools combine somehow creatively fly basically exposed used notion grad school writing blog write hard focus know term used published book good ca ignore came like right began professor book notion skill really important career satisfaction following passion actually really get good something use skills leverage big question book okay well get really good looked back grad school experience like huh focus thing used wonder generally applicable knowledge sector started thinking became clear interesting storyline emerged okay actually undistracted concentration important esoteric theoreticians important important important involved deep work hypothesis across whole knowledge work sector focus important accidentally created circumstances lot focus sort prerequisite basically say knowledge work basically kind skill acquisition kind major effort world break apart little bit yeah key aspect focus concentrating hard something without distraction big theme work context shifting kills human capacity think change paying attention something different really even brief try bring back main thing causes huge cognitive makes hard think clearly even think okay look writing code writing essay multitasking windows closed notifications every five six minutes quickly check like inbox phone initiates contact shift brain right gon na start suppress neural networks gon na try amplify others pretty complicated process actually sort neurological cascade happens rip away halfway go back trying switch back original thing even though also brain process switching emails trying understand contexts result ability think clearly goes really fatiguing mean long enough get midday like okay ca think anymore exhausted kind perfect number minutes would say talking focusing particular task one minute five minutes minutes minutes possible kind context switch maintaining deep focus every minutes thinking like maybe selfish kind perspective think programming focused particular design little bit maybe small scale particular function large scale system shift focus happens like like wait minute library achieve little task something like look danger zone go internets kind context switch opposed thinking particular problem switch thinking like consuming integrating knowledge plug solution particular problem definitely feels like context switch really bad thing setting aside always really trying much possible go deep stay like really long period time well mean think looking library relevant probably okay know would count full context shift semantic networks involved relatively similar right thinking type solution thinking coding thinking type functions really gon na get hit switch context something different unresolved obligation really worst possible thing could would look like email inbox right emails ca answer right completely different like context emails like okay grant funding issue something like different coding leaving unresolved like someone needs something gon na try pull attention back second worst would something emotionally arousing like let glance twitter sure nice calm peaceful right could devastating gon na expose something emotionally arousing gon na completely mess cognitive plateau come back okay let try code really difficult information emotion yeah killers trying would recommend least hour time could take minutes completely clear residue whatever thinking coding minutes might getting minutes actual sort peak lex going right hour least get good minutes plus partial minutes really good chunk get lot done get exhausted sort pull back little bit yeah one beautiful people read book deep work know long time people probably familiar many concepts still pretty profound stayed long time something adding terms actually solidifies concepts like words matter pretty cool sort comment struggle difficult maintain focus prolonged period time days able accomplish several hours kind work happy forget productive satisfied life feel fulfilled like joyful less dick people life afterwards beautiful thing find opposite kind thing much irritable like feel like accomplish anything stress negative emotion builds longer able sort enjoy hell amazing life sense deep work source lot happiness love ask cover book integrate deep work life different scheduling strategies would recommend high level different ideas well mean big fan time blocking right facing work day allow inbox list sort drive come day think wan na next mean big plan saying time available let make plan meeting appointment left actually wan na half hour gon na work minute block gon na work hour gon na try fit actually half hour gap two meetings take advantage go run five errands kind batch together blocking advance wan na time available mean find much effective discipline time blocking much easier actually see want example deep work get handle things need happen find better places fit prioritize gon na get lot done going day saying next schedule every single day kind thing could try morning try plan yeah quarterly weekly daily planning semester quarterly level big picture vision trying get done fall let say winter like want deadline coming academic papers end season working wan na many chapters done book something like like big picture vision wan na get done weekly look look week put together plan like okay week gon na look like need gon na make progress things maybe need hour every morning see monday really empty day gon na day really need nail writing something like every day look weekly plan see block actual hours three scales quarterly weekly daily talking actual times day versus alternative end lot sure best way scheduling duration time called luxury meetings like religiously meetings academics jealous way yeah know zoom meetings find one worst tragedies pandemic opportunity okay positive thing time family sort reconnect many ways really interesting able remotely sort waste time travel kinds things negative actually things also sourced negative negative like seems like people multiplied number meetings easy schedule nothing draining intellectually philosophically spirit destroyed even minute zoom meeting like meaning life yeah every zoom meeting existential crisis kierkegaard internet connection hell talking oh meetings luxury really allow certain things need like important things like deep work sessions last way longer maybe planned mean goal try schedule goal schedule sit focus particular task hour hope keep going hope get lost find okay way go time blocking something actually adult operate real world magic time blocking well mean magic intention magic varied responsibilities often juggling multiple jobs essentially academic stuff teaching stuff book stuff business surrounding book stuff mindset deep work session going well rock roll let go like one big keys time block least way even sell planner help people time block many columns discipline oh initial schedule changes move one next time get chance move one column fix time remaining words bonus made schedule stuck like actually like get prize right like prize intentional plan time change plan fine like state wan na basically point day thought time remains gave thought thing even though lot meetings types things various jobs basically prioritize deep work get yelled lot kinda strategy like okay okay getting yelled lot feel rolling yeah well like writing think writing hard certain way really get roll sense think difficult working proofs hard pull away proof start get traction couple hours feel pins tumblers starting click together progress made really hard pull away willing get yelled almost everyone course also positive effect pulling things going great kind excited resume yeah opposed stopping dead end true extra force procrastination comes stop dead end return task yeah cold start yeah whenever feel like stage submitted papers recently sort starting something cold takes way long get going hard hard get motivation schedule time yeah like feel like something give need early stages know gon na read hard papers gon na hard understand gon na idea make progress motivating deadlines okay like therapy session seems like get stuff done deadlines one implied powerful things time blocking kind deadline artificial real sense urgency think possible get anything done world without deadlines deadlines work well well mean clear motivational signal short term get effect like time blocking think strong effect get saying exact time gon na work debate every three minutes take break right like big issue saying gon na go write gon na write mind saying well obviously gon na take breaks gon na write forever right like well right let go little bit longer five minutes take break like probably look internet constantly battle hand time block schedule like got two hours put aside writing supposed break scheduled fight right maybe larger scale deadlines give similar sort effect know supposed working due perhaps describing much healthier sort giving talk new email book process mean general talk creating process giving process strict yeah deadlines talking like papers like main type deadline work well papers definitely publications like say podcast publish podcast early next week one book coming love sort support amazing book fly vegas thursday run miles david goggins want podcast conversation life like wan na hotel vegas like freaking david goggins yelling hour thing actually possible still hard softer deadline right sort life imposes kinds deadlines yeah papers nice actual deadline almost referring like pressure people put hey man said gon na get done two months ago gotten done see like pressure yeah maybe first think hate agree way david goggins yell probably top productivity technique think get lot done yelling see like try get things done early like flex also like idea get done today due midnight got lot night get head get sick like get bad night sleep ca think clearly like flex process like philosophical aspect book deep work something human deep wrangling world ideas mean aristotle talked go back read ethics trying understand meaning life eventually ends ultimately human capacity contemplate deeply kind like teleological argument things humans therefore must somehow connected ends said ultimately found meaning touching sort intimation correct try build life around regularly thinking hard stuff interesting like get fitness habit going feel try get cognitive habit like got mean look bag somewhere notebook thinking uber ride like could get working new proof train train appreciate certain things time hope accretes well let talk demons wonder like deep work world without email books symbolize life want live okay like despite appearances adult point life actually live constant chaos said like anxiety hate seems like always giant mess almost like whenever establish whenever successful processes deep work add stuff top introduce chaos like want look mirror certain point say like hell like keep something fundamental really need fix chaos right like seen video like routine seemed structured deep fact really envious like chaos video many sessions go way longer get enough sleep main introduction chaos taken many things list see mean suppose problem everybody deals saying saying like trouble saying much cool shit life okay listen nothing love world boston dynamics robots spot yeah giving spot gon na say yeah giving spot want computer vision stuff hell okay item go texas texas everything happening interesting people surprises right power outages texas constant changes plans kinds things sleep less personal stuff like people life sources stress kinds things feel like introspective bring onto suppose lot people kind thing flourish pressure wonder hack developed habit early life need let go need fix interesting things yeah essentially interesting yeah interesting things well one things talked deep work really important end day putting yeah like think ever done life yeah well see started early got married early real job grad student wife real job figured work work hey work home wan na campus whatever real early got habit end work postdoc kind easy job right put artificial like wan na train like professor gon na busier demands professors beyond research postdoc added artificial large things middle day basically exercise two hours middle day productive meditation stuff like still maintaining nine five like okay wan na get really good putting artificial constraints stay wan na get flabby job easy became professor paying ton kids really choice probably keeping away cool things time people stop bothering well successful life otherwise going easy go full hunter thompson like nobody wants nobody functional wants vicinity like driving attract people similar behavior pattern live chaos going attract chaotic people becomes like prophecy feels like bothered guess coming around exactly saying like think one big hacks productive people met get married kids honestly perhaps counterintuitive gets like ultimate timetable enforcer yeah enforces lot timetables though huge kids huge productivity hit got weigh okay complicated thing though like think life starting podcast one cool opportunities put right like could talking mit four years ago like like research going well right everyone watches like okay podcast direction taking like couple years gon na something really monumental probably gon na probably lead right really feels like life going somewhere going somewhere interesting yeah unexpected yeah balance two things try throw motto less better know right less better know used motto website years ago things like interesting array right mit stuff also writing know couple things know interesting like couple bets placed couple different numbers roulette table many things really try things really well see goes like writing spent years years years training like wan na better writer wan na better writer started writing student books student really wanted write hardcover idea books started training would use like new yorker articles train break get commissions much smaller magazines practice skills took forever know today like actually get right new yorker took like decade small number things try really well connection sort value like general think worth seeing leads choice things grounded like little flame passion like love thing like sense say wanted write get good writing kind introspective moment thinking actually brings lot joy fulfillment yeah mean gets complicated wrote whole book following passion bad advice like first thing kind got infamous wrote back argument like passion cultivates right pushing back myth passion exists full intensity start propels actually reality get better something gain autonomy skill impact passion grows along people look back later say oh follow passion really mean passionate worthy goal actually cultivate much complicated introspection gon na identify like sure writer something like actually quoting social network last night clubhouse know heard wait ask invited clubhouse know means tech reporter invited clubhouse new book awesome well let know show first let mention clubhouse room last night kept plugging exactly said passion talk room focused burnout first clubhouse kind fascinating place terms mind would interesting analyze place talk email talk social networks clubhouse something different encountered places discord voice communication bunch people room eyes closed hear voices real time real time live happens live technically allowed record people still especially one big conversations whole point live different structures like discord fascinating discord server would hundreds people room together little icons mute unmute mics sitting voices able hundreds people interrupt first dynamic system see icons like mics muted muted basically everyone muted unmute starts flashing like okay let get precedence digital equivalent conversation faculty meeting make noises person finishing people realize okay person wants talk next purely digital see flashing faculty meeting interesting even talking visual element seems increase probability interruption darkness actually listen better interrupt create culture always gon na assholes actually exceptions everybody adjusts evolve beat room okay one fascinating aspect okay weird different zoom call video audio think video ads actually seems like subtracts second aspect fascinating video audio intimacy weird strangers connect much real way similar podcasts lot people new people bring okay first different voices like low voices high voices difficult judge discord could even see people culture funny profile pictures opposed actual face clubhouse actual face tell older person older person younger person discord could judge based voice something listening intimacy surprised different strangers feels almost like party friends friends friends met yet really like clubhouse also interesting innovation large crowd listens stage bring people onto stage people stage talking like five six seven eight sometimes people stage also thousands people listening know lot people surprised called social network seems like social links feed trying harvest attention feels like communication social network aspect follow people people follow like first social network actually correct use follow think likely see rooms feed bunch rooms going right people follow ones increase likelihood see room final result like list really interesting rooms like speaking russian quite bit practicing also like talking politics philosophy russian never done allows connect community community people like funny like go community people talking race welcomed never like literally never difficult conversation race like people place like fascinating musicians jazz musicians know could say lot places could created culture suppose twitter facebook allow culture something network stands android users probably iphone people less conspiratorial something less listen android person got iphone network funny like trolls people trying manipulate system know interesting downside reason going hate intimate pulls pulls successful people like really successful productive busy people huge time sink difficult pull interesting mean room well leaving room actually easy beautiful thing stage multiple people little button says leave quietly culture okay leave room little awkward leave asking questions actually interviewed book weird event supposed usually person interviewing would like okay time go normal normal way use room like opening app like know sam harris eric weinstein joe rogan showed today bill gates people stage randomly plugged step stage listen maybe wo contribute maybe say something funny leave addicting aspect reason time sink wan na leave noticed exceptionally busy people love think might pandemic might little bit yeah loneliness starved also really cool people yeah like last time talked sam harris whoever think anybody tyler like faculty like universities strive create taken years cultural evolution try get lot interesting smart people together run really strong faculty room together scheduling power like show none baggage scheduling pressure leave sorry pressure stay easy leave realize lot constraints meetings like faculty even stopping pandemic friend faculty colleague weirdness leaving weirdness leaving discovered something interesting final result observe fulfilling think beneficial addicting make sure moderate yeah interesting okay well maybe try mean look things make suspicious platforms feed full user generated content going sort algorithmic rating process weird incentives nudging producing content harvested monetized another company mean seems like ephemeral right talking feed actually showing interesting things happening right jockeying feed look clever something gon na get like count goes gon na influence friction cognitive friction guess involved listening smart people versus scrolling yeah something people see articles seem really read reporters negative competition new york times wrote article called unfettered conversations happening clubhouse yeah right picking tone even headlines like negative vibes press say let say well tell article saying cancelable conversations like biggest people world almost trolling press right press like press yeah press saying guys looking click bait genuine human conversations think honestly press like ca first lot work okay naval says like skipping journalists like interview go clubhouse interview might book somebody like journalist interviewing yeah traditional yeah good introduction try way use clubhouse show like like sorry like keep mentioning sam harris like person know like lot major faculty know max tegmark major faculty sitting show ask like oh book coming something talk book leave five minutes later go get coffee go bathroom interesting like journalistic gon na actually enjoy interview much like normal thing yeah like minutes hour questions audience right like event next week book launch like jason friede talking email using like thousand people watch virtually using sort traditional webinar clubhouse would situation could happen informally like jump like jason someone else jumps yeah interesting still closed even though lot excitement quite famous people sitting listening yeah numbers exactly high talking rooms like even huge rooms like thousand right probably like soho something exponential growth give seven months let one invite gets two invites gets four invites pretty soon everyone rooms feed gon na whatever marketing performance enhancing drugs something like exactly bunch competitors already like plus competitors sprung twitter spaces twitter creating competitor going likely destroy clubhouse much larger user base already social network would cautious course addictive element like said particular implementation early stages like yeah context switching problem yeah switch think fantastic stuck yeah keep context great yeah yeah think best way found use acknowledge things pull yeah used past like almost know go get coffee tune conversation use podcasts sometimes like play little bit podcast know turn problem pulls really interesting problem experience like somebody recognize like oh lex come come way question takes lot go like ignore yeah yeah pulled fascinating really cool people like source lot joy careful reason brought room entire club actually burnout brought brought david goggins process go know passion goes dips think trust mind tell whether getting close burnout exhaustion kind go david goggins model mean probably applying running feels like mind ca take capacity mean like arbitrary level navy seal thing right navy seal thing mean could put percent remarkable take one step time keep going similar idea process trust process keep following even passion goes ultimately look aggregate passion increase increase yeah think two things big strategy mine hope alignment like sometimes problem alignment good okay research struggling book stuff going well right add two waves together like oh pretty well periods like writing feel like getting anywhere good papers feeling good two things counteract sometimes fall sync gets rough everything everything cyclical good periods bad periods stuff typically coincide helps compensate coincide get really high highs like everything clicking get really low lows like research working program clicking feel like nowhere writing little rougher think concept burnout personally never experienced burnout way folks talk like like wan na anything ever like people like physical like hospital kind thing yeah worry used student writing like writing students student advice came lot students elite schools used call deep procrastination real really vivid replicatable syndrome stop able schoolwork like due professor gives extension professor gives incomplete says got gon na fail course hand ca right like complete stop ability actually work used counsel students issue often combination best analysis physical cognitive difficulties usually hard load right many majors many extracurriculars really pushing motivation sufficiently intrinsic motivational center completely board lot kids like dealing mit kids would whole town shooting fireworks got everyone hope going three majors wan na let people really interested doctor whatever motivation right place motivational psychologist would say locus control towards extrinsic end spectrum hardship could fritz whole system would always worried think lot lot seasonality go hard something weeks go easy semesters hard semesters easier take summer really low multiple scales day go really hard something hard cut five like every scale rest recovery really wan na avoid burn burnt pretty recently get minor burnt got couple papers trying work deadline weeks ago sleeping well things going knocks get sick usually know pushed far kind pulled back book launch book launch pulling back like seasonality rest recovery think crucial every scale daily monthly annual scale easy summer example think like great idea possible okay made realize exactly feel like even close burnout anything even though chaos feel right exact way seasonality even seasonality like always multiple seasons operating like said lot cool shit going always least one thing source joy always reason suppose fundamental thing known people suffer depression fundamental problem experience depression burnout like like life meaningless always answer like today could cool yeah contrive right contrive think really important like okay well going bad time start thinking mean look started podcast pandemic like going pretty bad know could something really interesting deep questions kyle newport voice love podcast way yeah think david foster wallace said key life unborable always kind taken heart like able maybe artificially generate anything like find something environment surroundings source joy like everything fun yeah read pale king goes deep boredom means like uncomfortable like uncomfortable meditation boredom like characters driven extremes bought three books boredom day really interested topic anxious book launch happening week like okay need something else idea might article first book like okay need something cool thinking worried like know launch gon na work pandemic gon na happen know gon na get exactly talking went bought bunch books beginning like whole sort intellectual exploration well think one profound ideas deep work expand much boredom yeah well deep work superficial idea boredom chapter called embrace boredom functionalist idea basically boredom regular schedule mind gon na form pavlovian connection soon feel boredom get stimuli forms connection never gon na tolerate deep work pragmatic treatment boredom mind better used idea sometimes get stimuli otherwise ca write three hours like gon na tolerate recently really interested boredom fundamental human drive right incredibly uncomfortable think things incredibly uncomfortable like hunger thirst serve really important purpose species right like something really distressing reason pain really uncomfortable need worry getting injured thirst really uncomfortable need water survive boredom uncomfortable interested notion boredom driving us towards productive action like species mean think like got us actually take advantage brains got us actually work fire got us start shaping stones hand axes figuring could actually sharpen stick sharp enough could throw melee weapon distance weapon hunting mammoth right boredom drives us towards action fascinated fundamental action instinct theory working sync like drive hunger introduced junk food got sync hunger makes us really unhealthy drive towards action overload distractions causes like cognitive action obesity type things short circuits system wants us things put things plate possibly really frustrated ca short circuiting wires comes back question well would ideal sort amount stuff type things like wanted look back ancestral environment say could build scratch much work work touch like paleo people trying get diets touch well see something made going deep one podcast listeners talking show like well get trying learn animals boredom sent cool article animal behaviorist journal know human boredom versus animal boredom trying figure puzzle wave high get wave low like know pandemic book launch research stumbling little bit pandemic needed nice high go case study well case study interesting set concepts even realize simple one people interesting push pull dynamic hunger trying understand hunger like probably relationship food know probably perfect nice way think diet action probably optimal diet response experience body telling us signal body sending hunger way boredom sending signal intellectual activities world creative activities essentially response signal yeah think analogy hunger instinct junk food short circuits yes like oh satisfy hyperpallitably end well think modern attention engineered digitally mediated entertainment boredom instinct oh take care hyperpallitable alternative gon na lead similar problem fasting lot lately like eating day month eating one meal day primarily meat fasting incredible focus wellbeing know feeling good okay put chart makes feel good fasting eating primarily meat based diet makes feel really good ultimately fasting fasted super long yet like seven day diet really like even fasting day hours gets touch signal fascinating like get listen learn listen body like okay hungry like little signal sends stuff get listen responds put food body like get like okay cool like food thing pacifies signal like sounds ridiculous okay could different types food feels different learn body wants reason fasting similar deep work embrace boredom fasting allowed go mode listening trying understand signal could say unhealthy appreciation fruit okay love apples cherries like know moderate take amount calories know calories matter let say calories calories cherries versus calories steak eat calories steak maybe little bit like green beans cauliflower going feel really good fulfilled focused happy eat cherries going gon na wake behind dumpster crying like naked like pits around yeah everything face yeah like bloated unhappy also mood swings know much hungrier next day sometimes takes couple days introduce carbs system many carbs starts unhealthy like go roller coaster opposed calm boat ride along river amazon something like fasting mechanism start listening body wonder kind guess meditation little bit little bit yeah listen boredom two years ago book called digital minimalism one things recommending people basically day fast digital personal entertainment social media online videos anything captures attention dispels boredom people thinking like oh detox like want teach body need distraction really interested wanted space could listen boredom like okay ca dispel ca look screen revel little bit start listen say really pushing towards take new stuff new technology table sort ask craving like activity equivalent calories meat little bit green beans side people go experiment like spend days hard first get used listening sort seeking really pushing towards pushing people towards connection pushing people towards want go around people pushing people towards high quality leisure activities like want go something complicated took weeks sometimes get touch boredom completely rewired thought want time outside work idea done much easier go back completely change digital life alternatives right trying abstain things like basically listening boredom experiment like boredom see drives digital cheese hits okay ca going drive well guess kind want go library came lot way lot people rediscovered library physical books physical books like go borrow like low pressure explore bring home read like sit window read nice weather outside used years ago listening boredom maybe elaborate little bit different experiences people quit social media days like recommend process ultimately goal yeah digital minimalism philosophy tech working backwards important figure actually like want want spend time ask okay place tech could amplify support things decide tech use process let actually get away everything let bored let really spend month getting really figuring actually want want spend time important makes feel good done bring back tech strategically help things right goal turns much successful people take abstention approach come tech life say whatever look instagram much like like much instagram bad thing want reduce bad thing new thing gon na spend less time looking instagram much less likely succeed longterm much less likely trying reduce sort amorphous negative moment like yeah bad would kind interesting look instead controlling behavior positive aiming towards powerful people like want life like role tech plays life connection wanting life like strong much much easier say yeah like using instagram part plan life really want life course gon na use instagram turns much sustainable way tame going quit social media days kind work work thinking like actually makes happy terms tools previously used try integrate back integrate maximize thing actually makes happy makes happy unrelated technology like actually want life like well maybe want outside nature two hours day spend lot time like helping community sacrificing behalf connections sort intellectually engaging leisure activity like reading trying read great books calm seeing sunset like create picture go back say well still need facebook group keep cycling group twitter toxic helping things well artist kind need instagram get inspiration know using instagram need phone computer follow artists check week like really start play number one thing differentiated experiment people ended sustainably making changes getting days people experimentation reflection like let try figure positive much successful people said sick using phone much gon na white knuckle days good got ta get away something last use social media currently yeah find lot people going process seek basically arrive similar place use social media primarily half right half went exercise quantified numbers sent reports yeah pretty good though yeah yeah roughly half probably got rid social media altogether exercise realized things care social media tools really helping half kept things life social media useful key thing knew deploying social media could put fences around example half kept social media almost none kept phone oh interesting yeah ca optimize know function trying optimize like huge hack like know using twitter lot rules use twitter suddenly take cost benefit ratio goes like way company advantage way towards advantage kind fascinating torn social media kind process actually done days probably like week time regularly thinking kind approach twitter works distinctly aware fact really enjoy posting twice day time checking previous post makes feel even negative comments go right past positive comments makes smile feel like love connection people especially people know even general makes feel like world full awesome people okay increase checking two know threshold probably like five six per day starts going anxiety world like negative comments actually stick mentally positive comments feel shallow yeah kind fascinating trying long stretches time think december january post check post check makes really happy made really happy recently started go go right back like drug addict check like know number number high good come happy one comes day full twitter celebrating humanity even fortunate lot positivity twitter general anxiety would even say would even say probably thing talking context switching almost like exhaustion would even say like negative feeling almost exhaustion creating anything beautiful life exhausted like existential exhaustion existential exhaustion wonder think possible use people seen use social media way describing moderation always going become people exercise get lots configurations people public presence example like unusual okay post one thing day audience likes kind thought like okay supports something value like sort informal connection audience exposed sort positive randomness okay say goal right way well need twitter phone day maybe every day five post check day writer friend ryan holiday writes stoics lot similar strategy posts one quote every day usually famous stoic sometimes contemporary figure posts positive thing like readers really love like dose inspiration spend time never interacting anyone social media right example figured important best way use tools amplify get advantages tools like looked looked twitter feed came curious lot see yelling people think social media medium changed cultural standards mean read neil postman read like amusing death social critic technology critic wrote lot sort technological determinism ways really influential idea lot work actually little fashion right academia ways properties presence technologies change things humans way really intended planned humans book different communication medium like fundamentally changed way human brain understands operates sort gets happened printed word widespread television changed media one ideas like degree get sometimes show little bit like degree like twitter particular changed way people conceptualized example debate discussion like introduced rhetorical dunk culture sort tribes giving ground tribes like complete different places times type discussion thought differently well yeah absolutely tend believe know think technological solutions like literally different features twitter could completely reverse much power different choices made could still highly engaging different effects perhaps negative hopefully positive yeah trying pull two things apart two ways social media let say could change experience reading major newspaper today one could little bit economic right internet made cheaper get news newspapers retreat paywall model way gon na survive paywall model really wan na make tribe within paywall happy wan na work sort determinist point view properties twitter arbitrary jack evan whatever let way influenced way people understand think world one influenced think kind started adjusting together thing mean trying understand part playing entrepreneurial idea particular dream startup thing artificial intelligence seems like trajectory creating social media type technologies different people thinking kind challenge way twitter done obvious best mechanisms still make exceptionally engaging platform clubhouse engaging negative effects example chrome extensions allow turn likes dislikes twitter seeing content twitter creates compelling experience still need would argue still need likes know tweet worth reading limited amount time need know valuable like great yelp reviews tweets something turned example account youtube turned wrote chrome extension turns likes dislikes views know many views video gets unless phone take recommendations youtube people distraction free tube big one people yeah worried distraction able control youtube rabbit hole rabbit hole know demons addictions whatever youtube okay keep clicking negative feelings come seeing views stuff created oh wan na see views yeah like like speaking things aware helpful things helpful emotionally feel like need create actually tooling javascript anybody able create sort control experience yeah well big unified theory social media bearish big platforms long future think moment three four major platforms gon na last right know okay perspective right start shorting stocks tell financial advice yeah robin hood think big mistake major platforms made took network effect advantage right original pitch especially something like facebook instagram people know right like use connect people already know makes network useful therefore value network grows quadratically number users therefore headstart way someone else catch shifted facebook took lead say gon na shift towards newsfeed model basically said going try moment get data get likes like gon na go towards actually seeing interesting stuff like seeing diverting information people took social internet impulse connect people digitally tools like group text messages whatsapp stuff like think tools oh connect people feed kind interesting competing everything else produce interesting content diverting think much fiercer competition example going podcast mean like okay guess twitter feed interesting right also podcast interesting something else could interesting think much fiercer competition network effects sense gon na see fragmentation call long tail social media need everyone know platform three four bespoke platforms use thousand people interested whatever ai comedy perfected interface maybe like clubhouse audio something pay worry attention harvesting gon na wildly entertaining like mean thinking comedians twitter best internet possible format expressing interesting comedians trying like like little clips little whatever like know long tail social media really comedians podcasts comedians run podcasts thought really really strong advantage one large platform everyone getting different options diversion like uplifting aspirational whatever types entertainment whole thing could fragment think glue holding together network effects think realized network effects destabilized centrifugal force anymore spinning faster faster twitter feed really much interesting streaming services really much interesting clubhouse much interesting podcasts feel like realize unstable ground actually yeah fascinating thing makes twitter facebook work mean newsfeed exactly right like duplicate news like social network newsfeed multiple different feeds better satisfying dopamine gamification figured yeah whatever create least provide pleasure gamification kind way scale large social networks mean guess implying able design kind mechanism forms people turning gamification mean people getting wise getting uncomfortable right offering something exist like sugar people realize sugar bad yeah sugar great yeah drinking lot great also realize problems long tail social media networks looked offer usually like deeper sense connection like usually interesting people share affinity carefully cultivated wrote new yorker piece couple years ago indie social media movement really got different technologies think technologies distraction focus much know macedon versus know whatever like forget discord like actually let forget protocols right idea okay lot long tail social media groups people getting think outweigh dopamine gamification strong connection motivation like group guys trying know better dads something like talk regular basis sharing stories interesting talks powerful thing one interesting thing scale twitter viral spread information sort twitter become newsmaker yeah think problem well yes wonder replaces reporting well reporters work know problem reporters journalism intermediary control mean problem russia currently creates shield people news interesting thing powerful thing twitter news originates individual creating news like former president united states twitter creating news elon musk creating news people announcing stuff twitter opposed talking journalist feels much genuine feels powerful actually coming realize need social network put announcement youtube type thing thinking right point right democratizing power internet fantastic old school internet nerd guy know telmed servers gophering worldwide web around right huge internet booster one big power put everything twitter think fact taken homogenized everything right everything looks moves low friction difficult call distributed curation right curation really happens little bit likes also algorithm look back pre web early web lot happening let say blogs people servers different blogs distributed curation happened order blog get people radar nothing gatekeepers legacy media time got links people respected would hear blog whole distributed curation filtering going think like presidential election information people getting internet first big internet news driven elections like daily costs drudge like blogs back ezra klein running blog dorm room point right would distributed fashion gain credibility okay people paid hard get paid attention blog paying attention get linked kid ezra whatever seems really sharp people noticing distributed curation solves lot problems see completely homogenized low friction environment like friction mean twitter random conspiracy theory whatever people like shoot spread whereas starting blog try push qanon something like probably gon na really weird looking blog gon na hard time like never gon na show people radar right everything said last statement would agree topic know ton guess think forget qanon yeah put qanon could also know know apologize know mean power downside mean hitler could blog today would potentially large following charismatic good words able express ideas whatever maybe able channel frustration anger people certain thing think power blogs also limitation trying solve ca solve yeah fundamental problem saying problem thesis nothing special large scale social networks guarantees keep existing important remember lot older generation internet activists people early days completely flabbergasted rise platforms say would take internet build version internet servers built whole distributed whole thing open protocols everyone anywhere world could use protocols machine talk machine democratic communication system ever built companies came along said gon na build servers put buildings internet first mile get private internet owned whole thing went completely entire motivation internet like yes gon na one person owns servers pay access one server talk anyone else server agree standard set protocols old guard pro internet people never understood move towards let build private versions internet build three four private internets use opposite basically well funny enough know follow jack dorsey also proponent helping fund create fully distributed versions twitter essentially thing would potentially destroy twitter think might financial business cases made sure seems another alternative opposed creating bunch like long tail creating ultimate long tail fully distributed yeah internet actually sort thinking long tail social media thinking like tech important like groups right know tech use actually implement digital social group whatever might use slack might use combination zoom matter think tech world wan na build beautiful protocol okay everyone gon na use federated server protocol worked x z one understands engineers need make get nerd like like okay every standard fit everything else one understands going meanwhile group bike enthusiasts like yeah jump zoom slack put blog tech really matter like built world curation rules sort social ecosystem generating lot value know happen lot money stake obviously large think mean look quickly americans left facebook right mean facebook savvy buy properties diversify right quick take standard facebook newsfeed everyone age something using one certain age using took like four years mean stuff believe people leave facebook overnight yeah like think facebook actually messed like enough two things messed enough people really leave aggressively good alternative leave think good alternatives pop would immediately happen stuff lot culturally fragile think mean twitter moment feeding certain type mean lot anxieties sort political sphere anyways twitter working moment could go well mean really arbitrary thing short little things wrote wired article earlier pandemic like crazy way trying communicate information pandemic weird arbitrary rules people screenshotting pictures articles part tweet thread say one slash like technology guys like really clearly convey information people know gamified dopamine hits weird medium reason us threads find pin screenshot mean technology communicate better using internet mean epidemiologists tweet threads mechanisms publishing make easier twitter mean evolving species internet fresh thing kind interesting think opposed twitter jack also complains twitter innovating fast enough almost like people innovating thinking productive life faster platforms operate catch point gap grows sufficiently jump people innovative folks create alternative perhaps distributed perhaps many little silos people jump continue kind way see think like substack example gon na pull twitter among things audience let say like slightly left center slightly left center like trump uncomfortable like postmodern critical theories made political action right like yeah twitter people talking made feel sort heard feeling little bit like nerd honestly probably rather subscribe four subs know gon na like barry andrew sullivan like jesse signals like substacks subscribe honestly knowledge worker anyways probably email day like innovation gon na group know gon na suck actually large group yeah lot energy trump gone guess probably gon na drive drove lot like trump people twitter like stuff fragile fascinating thing cause hung parler short amount enough know interface matters fascinating like ideas creating like substack two creating pleasant experience dictating experience right right hard one conclusions indie social media article ugliness matters mean even aesthetically clunkiness interfaces know degree social media companies spent lot money degree survivorship bias yeah right like twitter every time hear jack talks seems like surprised anyone else way twitter used mean basically way years ago like great statuses right friends follow see without really changing anything happened hit everything right support type interaction well also javascript model brendan naik talked implemented javascript like crappy version javascript days threw changed really quickly evolved really quickly become according stack exchange popular programming language world drives internet even backend mobile argument kind thing talking bike club people could literally create thing would run internet years something opposed trying get lucky trying think stuff solve particular problem stuff yeah stuff keep tinkering love yeah course sad thing timing luck matter ca really control problem yeah ca go back yeah like number one thing could lot success new platform go back time years thing kind think like totally new thing years would seem obvious mean people saying clubhouses lot stuff like clubhouse hit right kind thing similar tesla actually clubhouse got lot relatively famous people quickly effect like invite like oh like famous people wonder fomo like fear missing something really profound exciting happening social effects actually show huge fan javascript model like clubhouse dumb like simple interface like literally ca anything except unmute mute button leave quietly button yeah kind love single use technology sense like like trivial twitter kind started like facebook started like evolved quickly add features hope clubhouse stays way interesting alternatives mean even clubhouse though one issues lot platforms think bits cheap enough really need unicorn investor model mean investors need model really really imperative need something scale hundred million plus year revenue gon na require much seed angel investment gon na get much seed angel investment unless potential exit wide part portfolio depends one exiting actually need need satisfy investor model think basically case mean bits cheap everything cheap necessarily even like clubhouse investor backed right notion like needs major platform bike club necessarily need major platform interested mean know much money problem bets concentrate lot capital things right mean facebook like fantastic capital concentration machine crazy much even found capital world could concentrate ossify stock price small number people access right incredibly powerful possibility consolidate gather huge amount capital huge imperative hard bike club go lot money bike club see wall street bets bunch people get together mean bike could bunch different bike clubs kind team overtake yeah yeah gon na repurpose shelf stuff yes yeah gon na repurpose whatever office productivity something like clubs using slack build yeah yeah let talk email yeah right wrote book wrote yet another amazing book world without email maybe one way enter discussion ask hyperactive hive mind concept opened book yeah devil devil scourge hundreds millions think called book world without email real title world without hyperactive hive mind workflow publisher like get little bit pithy trying answer question deep work hard like valuable produce much higher people much happier check email day slack day started working book immediately deep work initial interviews done took five years pull threads together trying understand hard people actually find time stuff actually moves needle story thought heard report anywhere else took long pull together email arrives scene email spreads trace really picks steam early like makes move right pragmatic reasons replacing existing communication technologies better mainly fax machine voicemail memos right better right killer app useful wake came new way collaborating hyperactive hive mind like virus follows rats went western europe black pig email spread organizations wake came hyperactive hive mind workflow says okay guys way gon na collaborate work things fly unscheduled back forth messages boom boom boom let go back forth hey see client let see going followed email completely took office work need keep asynchronous back forth unscheduled messages got service need service required us check right time go numbers time get today average knowledge worker check one channels every six minutes every single thing organization talk colleagues talk vendors talk clients talk hr department asynchronous unscheduled back forth messaging service conversations spiraled control sort devolved lot work office constantly tend communication channels fascinating describing nobody ever paused whole evolution try create system actually works kind like huge fan cellular automata kind started simple mechanism like cellular automata kind grew overtake fundamental communication business also personal life yeah one big ideas unintentionality yeah right goes back technological determinism mean weird business book go deep philosophy go deep reason get paleoanthropology lot neuroscience kind weird book got real technological determinism right notion presence technology change people act big argument happened hive mind document specific examples right document example ibm maybe like mid late ibm monk headquarters gon na put internal email right convenient ran whole study talked engineer ran study adrian stundlich gon na run study figure much communicate still era expensive right provision mainframe ca provision like wan na know much communication actually happens went figured many memos many calls many notes great provision mainframe handle email handle communication moves email mainframe still fine three days melted people communicating six times estimate three days presence low friction digital communication tool drastically changed everyone collaborated enough time hands meeting guys figured need communicate lot gon na make us productive need emails emergent positive end amazing like email amazing like early days like frictionless communication mean email awesome like people say lot problems emails like people say lot problems twitter kinda cool send little note miracle right wrote originally new yorker piece year two ago called email mistake book go history email like come along solved huge problem problem fast asynchronous communication problem exist got large offices got large offices synchronous communication like let get phone time much overhead many people might talk asynchronous communication like let send memo ready read ready took long like huge problem one things talked way built cia headquarters need fast asynchronous communication built pneumatic powered email system pneumatic tubes throughout headquarters electromagnetic routers would put message plexiglass tube would turn brass dials location would stick things pneumatic tubes would shoot sort work way tubes show minute something floor general office suite want go point fact spent much money make work show important fast asynchronous communication large offices email came along productivity silver bullet miracle talked researchers working computer supported collaboration late trying figure gon na use computer networks productive building systems tools email showed wiped research map need build custom intranet applications need build communication platforms email could everything miracle application spread everywhere one things okay unintended consequences right miracle productivity silver bullet spread everywhere effective know like drug sure pandemic metaphor analogy drug like effective treating also blows whole immune system everyone gets sick well ultimately probably significantly increased productivity world kind hump plateaued fundamental question asking like okay take next keep increasing productivity think brought contention little bit book recent wired article puts newer numbers subscribed hypothesis hyperactive hive mind detrimental yeah helped productivity first right could fast asynchronous communication quickly sort exponential rise communication amounts got point hive mind meant constantly check email think made us unproductive actually pulling productivity think reason certainly going metric stagnating long time going think reason fallen added extra shifts books gon na work three hours morning gon na work three hours night think allowed us basically maintain stagnated growth shooting charts mean miraculous innovations computer networks built billion ubiquitous worldwide wireless internet infrastructure super computers pockets could talk anyone time productivity shoot charts brain ca context switch every six minutes fundamentally back context switching contact switching poison contact switching poison email forces contact switching psychology drags us expectation yeah right right think seen personal failure lens recently like oh addicted email bad etiquette email underlying workflow tool exonerate think would rather use pop fax protocol think easier issue hyperactive hive mind workflow collaborating different people back forth unscheduled messaging tend conversations right like metaphorical ping pong tables balls come back across pretty soon hit back stuff actually grinds halt workflow problem tool fact use collaboration let send messages back forth means ca far checking take break batch try better habits gon na slow things whole villain hyperactive hive mind workflow tool fine want tool go away wan na replace hyperactive hive mind workflow think gon na one biggest value generating productivity revolutions st century quote anonymous ceo pretty well known says gon na moonshot st century gon na importance much latent productivity suppressed figure things fly email figure think gon na hundreds billions dollars absolutely right question world without email look like fix email happens least vision identify well actually different processes make workday like things repeatedly often collaboration people useful things company whatever right processes implicitly implemented hyperactive hive mind thing like answering client questions shoot messages back forth thing posting podcast episodes figure fly main argument actually like industrial sector take processes say better way better mean way gon na minimize need unscheduled back forth messaging actually process engineering created massive growth productivity industrial sector th century knowledge work ca rock roll inbox actually say deal client questions well let put place process require us send messages back forth post podcast episodes let automate degree send message fly process process pressure inbox released check every six minutes still email mean like need send file sure use email coordinating collaborating email slack faster way hive mind mean slack solve anything better structured bespoke processes think gon na unleash massive productivity bespoke interesting thing like example actually emails obviously let say particular case schedule podcasts bunch different tasks fascinatingly enough could converted processes create process think also need build tools like email protocol helping us create processes different tasks mean think ultimately whole organization whole team involved think ultimately certainly lot investor money spent right try figure tools think silicon valley figured past couple years difference talking people deep work five years later scent air right much latent productivity yes gon na new tools think could help already tools exist mean different groups profile use things like trello basecamp asana flow schedule wants acuity like lot tools key think terms tool replace email instead think trying come process reduces back forth messages oh tool might help us yeah would push necessarily efficiency fact things gon na take time writing letter someone like high value activity probably worth thing killer back forth keep checking right scheduled together knew like interviews scheduling actually process publicist use shared document puts stuffs check twice week scheduling options say wan na one work one whatever takes time moment means almost back forth messaging podcast scheduling without like uk publisher put process place many interviews time like oh could really feel difference right back forth killer suppose individual people involved like said knowledge workers like carry responsibility creating processes like always asking first principles question converted process yeah start like control think ultimately teams think probably right scale try organizational scale gon na get bureaucracy right right elon musk gon na dictate everyone tesla something like much remove get bureaucracy team six working together whatever powertrain software figure processes wan na ultimately also creating culture saying like email sending email hell taboo like destructive productivity team sending email opposed helping develop process ultimately automate trying spread message context switches poison get much science think underestimate much kills us wrench away context look message come back mindset huge thing ask someone take attention something look back three four times like gon na figure fly every message gon na require five checks inbox wait created whatever point context shifts done huge disservice someone day would like professional athlete like hey favor need go press interview get gon na carry sandbag sprint hill like completely exhaust muscles go play game like course gon na ask athlete like incredibly physically demanding thing right game something easy thoughts question mark like hey wan na jump call gon na six back forth messages figure kind cognitive equivalent right taking wind someone yeah way people listening recently posted job openings us help thing one things people surprised work many spreadsheets processes involved like claude shannon right talked communication theory information theory takes time come clever code upfront spend time upfront figuring spreadsheets trying get people board communication going forward much efficient time using much less bandwidth right pain upfront quicker right send email spend half day next six months saved emails tough question know computer science perspective often optimize create processes okay like saying pleasurable increase productivity sometimes enjoy process creating processes actually never like negative effect productivity obsessed processes nice problem essentially mean problem mean let look one sector developers right agile methodologies like scrum kanban basically workflow methodologies much better hyperactive hive mind man programmers get pretty obsessive know ever talked whatever level three scrum master get really obsessive like happen exactly way probably seven times complex needs hoping nerds like know like broadly probably issue right careful go fiddling path like needs let reduce messages let roll know ca save get process right right wrote article kind recently called rise fall getting things done profiled productivity guru named merlin mann talked movement called productivity prong like elite speak term early people became convinced could combine productivity systems software could find right software right configuration could offload difficulty work happened machines kind figure could sort crank widgets whole thing fell apart work hard hard making decisions work hard system really sort balance context switches poison got ta get rid context switches like something working good enough get rid context switches get yeah psychological process ocd nature like literally embarrassingly enough lost shit many processes involve python scripts rule use spaces underscore zone like rules like format stuff okay like lose shit somebody space maybe capital letters like okay space feeling like something perfect opposed python script allowing flexibility around create programmatic way flawless everything working perfectly perfect actually strive perfection stress like lot stress seeking escape context switching almost stressing errors like process functioning always anxiety like wonder gon na succeed wonder gon na succeed yeah think probably mean mindset right computer science right chicken egg guess lot processes working much rougher like okay instead letting clients email time weekly call send breakdown everything committed right process works okay get asked lot questions javascript guy company email office hours basecamp right come office hours cuts lot back forth right gon na instead emailing project trello board weekly really structured status meeting real quick going needs let go everything inboxes send many messages like rough level granularity gets way parts ca automate turn process many parts like think remain perfect world parts email still useful recommend emails look like write emails send yeah think email good delivering information right think like fax machine something really good fax machine need send something send file need broadcast new policy something like email great way bad collaboration conversation like trying reach decision something trying learn something trying clarify something like one answer type question think email see thing like talk often kind new interaction sure yeah book coming process say think lot novel interactive experiences yeah think fine could every novel experience okay little bit exchange fine like think fine stuff comes transom hear someone heard think fine mean email best starts kill us collaboration happening back forth moved bulk inbox back meg ryan movie like got mail like right load wait vote like oh got message yeah like let send message interesting right back aol days talking bulk business world email replaced actual communication communication protocols required accomplish anything everything happening messages get stuff done repeatable collaborations processes require check inboxes inbox serve like inbox includes hearing interesting people right sending something hey know saw thought might like think great probably bunch people listening like yeah work team use email start revolution ground yeah well asymmetric optimization first identify processes change change socially careful necessarily say okay new process hey got ta get report ready think get draft dropbox folder noon monday grab wo touch tuesday morning look changes office hours always scheduled tuesday afternoon anything catches attention grab told designer cc cob tuesday final version ready take polish whatever like person end like great glad cal plan need need edit tomorrow whatever right actually pulled process means gon na get report together without go back forth asymmetrically optimize things begin conversation maybe book comes place sort slide across desk buy book leave leave give everybody team okay solved bulk email problem case made even like communication move away email example guy recently know know comedians guy named joey diaz yeah interaction recently guy first sweetest human despite comedy sounds like sweetest human big proponent pick phone call makes uncomfortable people call like know thing kind gets everything done quicker think remove anxiety case made email could still efficient way mean look interact someone lot efficiency synchrony right something distributed system theory know go synchronous asynchronous networks huge amount overhead asynchronous actually protocols required solve things asynchronous networks significantly complicated fragile synchronous protocols real time usually better also interaction like social connection standpoint lot information human voice back forth yeah call generational right like generation comfortable talking phone way like younger generation older generation comfortable well call people whereas happy medium good friends talk regular phone calls okay yeah call schedule schedule yeah text like yeah wan na talk sometime soon ever process around friends really feel like feel like well like lot interesting friend possibilities like interesting problem right like really interesting people talk well one problem one introversion afraid people get really stressed like freak picked good line work yeah perhaps goggins thing like facing fears whatever almost like timetables thing deep work nice thing processes automates sort automates away context switching ensures important things yeah like prioritizing thing email everything done email lazy way like social networks easy things first yeah important process also enforces important things important things like okay sounds weird like social connection one important things human existence yeah paradoxical thing got digital minimalism sacrifice behalf connection stronger connection feels right sacrificing time attention behalf someone tells brain serious relationship social media paradoxical effect making people feel less social took friction brain like yeah commenting person whatever retweeting sending texts hard enough perceived strength social connection diminishes talk go spend time whatever gon na feel better friction good thing friends end call take couple minutes schedule next never like haircuts something right like schedule never gon na get haircut right like okay wan na talk next yeah really good idea call friends like every years something dramatic maintain friendship like murder somebody really like yeah exactly want careful man joey might ask yeah one favorite things lex need come new jersey exactly gon na robot dog gon na go jersey special human love comedian world shaking know listen joe rogan folks kind something interesting mit academia shaking world little bit like podcasting comedians paving way podcasting like andrew huberman neuroscientist stanford front mine like podcasting podcasting course necessarily podcasting computer science currently right feels like could lot free spirit comedians implemented people academically trained actually niche specialty yeah results mean knows experiment looks like results able talk robotics joey diaz says drops every sentence seen actually shift within colleagues friends within mit becoming much accepting kind thing interesting interesting seeing okay seeing popular like wait minute well getting popular know think georgetown example know interesting think happens popularity combined good conversations people respect like oh okay wait thing fun listen shitty zoom lecture work like something something interesting nobody actually knows like clubhouse something nobody figured medium take legitimate medium education fun well innovation think bring professors yeah know joe rogan professors field yeah exactly bring mit guys remember well big challenge feel would ask big philosophical questions people like really well example lot excellent papers lot theory right temptation go papers think possible actually done much think possible requires lot preparation probably things actually field aware dance would love able try hit right actually getting core interesting ideas opposed talking philosophy time large audience people wan na inspired disciplines necessarily know details lot people like really curious thinking pivoting careers software engineering would love hear people like computer science even like theory yeah like idea big ideas push interesting fight yeah well computerphile numberphile youtube channels channels watch like chess exceptionally popular understand maybe time hell talking talking like move better move love passion genius people overhearing know exciting look like scott aronson blog settled optimized yeah like hardcore complexity theory enthusiasm like terry tao blog little bit humor terry tao blog used yeah would going know new affine group whatever mean equations well case scott aronson good able turn like inner troll comedian keeps fun best kinds books philosophical guy wrote compoacum yeah yeah know exploring different ways communicating science exciting world speaking got ta ask computer science yeah right mean lot lot work inspired deep thinking productivity different angles rigorous work mathematical work computer science theoretical computer science let ask scott aronson question like something stands particular beautiful inspiring really incites football computer science maybe mathematics mean like theory particular always liked theory notion impossibilities kind specialty within context distributed algorithms specialty impossibility results idea argue nothing exists solves nothing exists solve faster think really interesting goes way back turing original paper computable numbers connection german eichschlussdung problem basically german name hilbert called decision problem know english written english accessible paper lays foundation theoretical computer science insight like well think like algorithm mean figures like effective procedures turing machines basically algorithms could really describe turing machine number imagine like computer code could take source file treat binary version file like really long number right like every program finite number natural number realized like one way think problem like kind mike sipser approach sort language infinite number strings language basically imagine problem represented infinite binary string every position like one means string language zero means applied cantor th century said okay natural numbers countable countably infinite infinite binary strings use diagonalization argument show uncountable vastly problems algorithms basically anything come part almost certainly solvable computer like let give particular example figured first computability proof said let walk little bit simple logic halting problem ca solved algorithm kicked whole enterprise things ca solved algorithms things ca solved computers theory since wrote proving something impossible sort stricter version like proving bounds performance different algorithms yeah bounds upper bounds right say algorithm least well worse looking particular algorithm possibility proof say algorithm ever could ever solve problem algorithm could ever solve halting problem problem centric making something different making conclusive statement problem yes somehow satisfying cause philosophically interesting yeah mean goes back get back plato reducto ad absurdum arguments start way infinite number solutions ca go say let assume sake contradiction existed something solves problem turn crank logic blow universe go back say okay original assumption solution exists ca true think philosophically like really exciting kind beautiful thing specialize within distributed algorithms like time bound possibility results like algorithm solve problem faster setting infinite number ways might ever many papers one caught eye smooth analysis dynamic networks write problem worst case perspective often leads extremely strong lower bounds strong results motivated key question bond robust sense captures fundamental difficulty introduced dynamism bond fragile sense poor performance describes depends exact sequence adversarial changes fragile lower bounds leave open possibility algorithms might still perform well practice sense impossible bounds discussion presents interesting question like idea robust fragile bounds make kind tension provably bounds prove robust something bit fragile also way answering particular paper say hell dynamic networks distributed outcomes know come idea smooth analysis yeah well okay smooth analysis idea spielman tang came context sequential algorithms like normal world algorithm runs computer looking algorithm called simplex algorithm basically trying whatever find hole around group points algorithm worked really well practice analyze would say ca guarantee gon na work well practice right inputs thing could run really long right practice seemed really fast smooth analysis came said let assume bad guy chooses inputs could anything like really bad ones gon na simplex numbers gon na randomly put little bit noise numbers said put little bit noise numbers suddenly simplex algorithm goes really fast like oh explains lower bound idea could sometimes run really long fragile bound could run really long time exactly worst pathological input collaborators brought world distributed algorithms brought general lower bounds right world dynamic networks distributed algorithm bunch algorithms different machines talking trying solve problem sometimes network imagine connected network links dynamic network change right talking ca talk anymore connected person really hard environment mathematically speaking lot really strong lower bounds imagine network change time bad guy like hard things well algorithm running every single node network trying say something kind makes kind definitive sense performance algorithm yeah submitted new paper couple weeks ago looking simple problem messages network want everyone get network change pretty well pipeline algorithms work basic algorithms work really well network change every round lower bounds says takes really long time way like matter algorithm come way network change way really slows progress basically right smooth analysis says yeah seems like really know really bad luck network changing like exactly right way needed screw algorithm said randomly add remove couple edges every round adversary trying choose worst possible network tweaking little bit case new paper mean blinded submission maybe whatever basically anonymous friend submitted paper anonymous friend mine yeah yeah whose paper accepted even adding like one random edge per round cool thing simplest possible solution problem blows away lower bound really well like fragile lower bound like almost impossible actually keep things slow wonder many lower bounds smash open kind analysis show fragile interest yeah distributed algorithms ton really famous strong lower bounds things go wrong really really wrong lower bound arguments work like approach whole notion fragile versus robust like well let go throw little noise becomes solvable maybe lower bound really something worry know kind embarrassed really uncomfortable really embarrassing lot people okay ocd thing spaces feels really good prove nice bound say bound fragile gon na sad kid walks like lunchbox back home like lower bound matter yeah think care know feels like lot theory math machismo like whatever hard bound prove think show something fragile important really important practice right think kind theoretical computer science living world like mathematics main effort think valuable develop ideas necessarily interesting whether applicable real world yeah care applicability yeah think kind really terrible computers ca anything useful computers know code know productive members like technological society think things percolate exactly percolate world theory world algorithm design pull theory suddenly useful algorithm design gets pulled world practice say well actually make algorithm lot better practice really servers x z make super efficient think mean tell teach theory phd students georgetown show sort funnel like okay theory eventually stuff percolate affect end know phone long long tunnel question asking highest philosophical level fascinating like take system distributed system network introduce little bit noise like many problems nature fundamentally changed little introduction noise yeah especially distributed algorithms model everything like way work incredibly precise exactly mathematical exactly network works state machine algorithms state machines rounds schedulers super precise prove lower bounds yeah often lower impossibility results really get hard edges exactly model works see published paper paper mentioned kind introduced idea distributed algorithms world think got traction followups submitted next mean honestly issue next like result fell easily shows mathematical machismo problem fields good chance paper wo accepted enough mathematical nice finding even showing little bit noise dramatic make dramatic statement big surprise us figured show hard venues theoretical work okay fascinating tension exists disciplines like one machine learning despite power machine learning deep learning impact real world main conferences machine learning still resistant application papers sort application paper broadly defined meaning like finding almost like would like darwin like going around collecting information saying huh interesting like popular blogs yet paper really accepted wonder think whole world deep learning perspective theory make whole discipline success neural networks science excited possibilities might discover neural networks think fundamental engineering discipline something theoretical might crack open one days understanding something deep optimization systems learn convinced tegmark mit tegmark yeah tegmark right notion always convincing fact models inscrutable fundamental gon na get better better end know reason practicing computer scientists often ai working ai industry like worried much existential threats see reality multiplying matrices num pi something like right yeah tweaking constants hoping classifier fitness god sakes submission deadline actually like gets like feels like linear algebra tdm right anyways really convinced idea understand better better going theory perspective gon na make engineering discipline mind gon na end okay forget metaphors neurons things gon na put mathematical kind elegant equations differentiable equations kind work well gon na need little bit ai thing plumbing like let get little bit pattern recognizer noise module let connect mean know feel better know like reasonable prediction gon na gon na become less inscrutable gon na become engineerable gon na ai things gon na little bit control piece together different classification black boxes one problems might interesting parallels might provide intuition know neural networks large lot know talking know dynamic networks distributed algorithms one problems analysis neural networks know lot nodes lot edges able interpret control different things difficult fields trying figure like mathematically form clean representations like like one node contains information particular thing nodes correlated like unique knowledge like ultimately boils trying simplify thing goes nature like deeply connected like dynamic know hundreds millions billions nodes distributed sense like zoom thing representation understanding something individual nodes little exchange thing thing stephen wolfram talk cellular automata difficult math huge collection distributed things acting almost like feels like almost impossible kind theoretical work traditional sense almost becomes completely like biology become biologist opposed theoretician study experimentally yeah think big question guess right yeah large size interconnectedness like deep learning network fundamental task good yet using wrong metaphor mean human brain learns much fewer examples much less tuning whatever whatever whatever probably requires get like deep mind networks running yeah really know one thing observed yeah mundane nature working models tends lead people think like could skynet could like lot pain get know thermostat want lot open questions course distributed distributed network humans use systems like system neural network also like little algorithms controlling behavior humans social networks possible toaster whatever opposite skynet taken scale well used individual humans controlling behavior actually skynet effect scale might might know yeah like twitter creating little mini skynet mean happens twirls ramifications world really much different robot tentacles bunch servers yeah destructive effects could mean could political could also like know could probably make interesting case virus coronavirus spread twitter minds people like fear misinformation interesting ways mixed maybe pandemic sufficiently dangerous could created weird like instability maybe things might create instability like somebody god forbid detonates nuclear weapons somewhere maybe destructive aspect would much military actions way news spread twitter panic creates yeah yeah mean think great case study right like happened suggesting likes let nuclear bomb meant coronavirus okay yeah think really interesting case study interested counterfactual like virus first would get hear whatever nightly news talk local health board talk mitigation decisions would probably necessarily sort localized like community trying figure gon na gon na happen like see schools like grew new jersey localized school districts even though sort really bad viral numbers school grew open since fall localized like teachers parents wan na comfortable live school district right montgomery county billion dollar year budget kid school district ca closed know interested counterfactual yes information moving around effects discourse talking earlier neil postman style effects twitter shifts people sort dunk culture mindset give inch team used fired politics unique attributes twitter throw coronavirus suddenly see decades public health knowledge lot honed hiv epidemic thrown window lot happening twitter suddenly public health officials using give inch team mindset like well say might validate something wrong need say maybe like stop like twittery way probably way public health officials would thinking like well said masks team said masks ca give inch got ta careful like ca tell people okay vaccinated might giving inch twittery mind right impact twitter way think discourse dunking culture give answer team slam dunks completely right completely wrong rhetorical strategy incredibly simplistic also way think right debate combined terribly election year pandemic yeah election year pandemic wonder could smooth analysis let run simulation times little bit noise yeah see dramatically change behavior system okay talked love proving something impossible quite still open problems complexity algorithms let ask p equal np probably probably p equals np kind really surprised somebody proves yeah would proof look like would even would mean would proof look like possible universe could p equals np something insightful could say could true mean complexity theorist every complexity theorist know convinced equal basically working anymore mean million dollars stake solve proof one millennium prizes okay think p equals np proof gon na eventually happen think gon na fall gon na super simple hard people think theory lot theoretical computer science based results done huge extrapolation lot obfuscating deeper mathematics like happens lot lot happened times work obfuscate say well algorithm much memory connected network okay setup trying see fast solve problem people bounds end turns like obfuscating underlying mathematical thing already existed right happened paper quite fond ago looking problem called contention resolution put unknown set people shared channel trying break symmetry like ethernet whatever one person use time try break symmetry bounds people proven years long takes right like discovered point one combinatorial result early lower bound proofs come fact improved lot simplified lot could put one paper like really okay new paper submitted couple weeks ago found could take lower bound proofs contention resolution problem could reprove using shannon source code theorem actually breaking contention really building code distribution network sizes code source plug high entropy information source plug source code theorem says noiseless channel ca send things faster rate entropy allows exact lower bounds fall back right like type thing happens famous lower bounds distributed algorithms turned algebraic topology underneath covers gertl prize working sense gon na happen point someone really smart gon na exciting gon na realize sort representation going turing machines trying sort efficiently compute existing mathematical result applies someone something guess could ai theorem provers kind thing could yeah mean well yeah mean theorem provers like means fun bunch carefully formulated postulates take point yeah yeah okay small tangent kind implying mathematics almost feels like kind weird evolutionary tree ultimately leads back kind ancestral fundamental ideas like somehow connected sense think math fundamental universe like slowly trying understand patterns discovered little game play amongst try fit little patterns world yeah question right physicist question mean probably discovered camp theoretical physics know feel like stronger claim answering question everything comes back everything comes back mean physics fact universe well okay complicated question often think deeply result describe fundamental reality nature reason hesitated something taught seminar little work called biological algorithms notion physicists use mathematics explain universe right unreasonable mathematics works well yeah differential equations explain need know thermodynamics gravity types things well movement within intersection computer science biology kind wolframian guess really algorithms explanatory right like trying explain parsimoniously something like ant colony something like going ultimately gon na explained equation like physics equation gon na explained algorithm like algorithm run distributedly going explain behavior mathematical quite mathematical think algorithm like lambda calculus brings back world mathematics thinking loud basically abstract math sort like unreasonably effective explaining lot things feel like glimpse like super theoretician really famous results even sort middling career theoretician keep encountering think solving problem computers algorithms much deeper underlying math shannon shannon entropy entropy really know goes way back whatever boyle way back looking early physics anyways think amazing yeah could flip side could brains draw much pleasure deriving generalized theories simplifying universe naturally see kind simplicity everything yeah whole newton einstein right say must right predictive oh quite predictive mercury wobbles little bit think set turn einstein get bohr like einstein actually statistical yeah would hard also know like smooth analysis fits little bit noise like say something clean system little bit noise like average case actually different mean like quantum mechanics comes like ugh randomness yeah would complex statistics yeah determined yeah next book ambitious fundamental core reality comma advice productive work ask possible overview brief comments wisdom process publishing book process entail different options recommendation somebody wants write book like nonfiction book discovers something interesting world usually advise follow process follow process try reinvent think happens lot try reinvent way publishing industry work like kind like business model ways like want want write thousand words day want gon na put internet publishing industry specific works like got started writing books young age sold first book age way found family friend agent said trying make agent explain works world works give hard truth would year old conditions could year old sell book would look like explained well subject made sense write would type writing publications validate blah blah blah get agent first learned whole game plan executed rough game plan nonfiction get agent first agent gon na sell publishers like never sending something directly publishers nonfiction writing book first right gon na get advance publisher sold gon na primary writing book fact circumstances hurt already written already written yeah trying sell well guess agent first sell agent agent sells publishers much easier get agent book deal thought ca get agent would start also way works good agent know editors lunch editors always like hey projects coming looking one authors way deals happen emailing manuscript slush pile yeah first agent takes percentage publishers process comes take also cut probably ridiculous try reinvent system probably frustrated percentage everyone takes relative much bureaucracy efficiency ridiculousness system recommendation like one ant stop trying build ant colony well create process work book gon na get published separate question economic question like create like something like putting aside lot people encounter wan na publish book main publisher invent rules works right alternative though downside lot downsides like almost like publishing opinion piece new york times versus writing blog reason writing blog post medium ca get way attention legitimacy long lasting prestige new york times article nevertheless people writing prestigious newspaper quote unquote prestigious easier well depends goal like push towards big publisher think goal huge ideas want impact gon na impact even though like actually different ways measure impact right world ideas world ideas also yeah world ideas kind like clubhouse thing even audience large people audience interesting like conversation feels like long lasting impact among people different disparate industries also starting conversations kind stuff yeah like book goals would solve much better ways getting goals might part right financial aspect get keep mean podcast probably gon na crush book gon na anyways right yeah wan na get directly certain audiences crowds might harder traditional publisher better ways talk crowds could clubhouse new technologies books gon na effective way find way new crowd idea like wan na leave dent world ideas vulnerable old publisher put book nice hard cover things goes long way lot mean difficult actually much involved putting together book get books bookstores kind stuff efficiency standpoint mean time involved trying process right like said process got process mean know like jaco recently started imprint couple huge overhead mean run business like jaco good case study right got fed simon schuster dragging feet said gon na start imprint gon na publish kid book runs businesses right think world like already run partner whatever origin like yeah run businesses know run businesses people like run businesses terrible yeah yeah well especially kinds businesses right wan na launch business different technology business different different yeah different yeah yeah mean like okay need copy editors graphic book binders need contract printer oh printer slots try mean get need shut brain get frustrated system could clearly improved thing mentioning like inefficient every time go dmv something like think like ah could done much better thing worry editor guess would come publisher like would much supervision book receive like hey think long think title like title much choice title cover presentation branding kind stuff yeah mean depends right comes relationship editor writing depends editor depends like point seventh book write lot major publications point feel like voice level craft comfortable right editor gon na kind gon na trust gon na big picture like losing thread seems like could longer whereas first book wrote notes start lot sentences use contractions scientific writing use contractions probably use contractions way go back rewrite whole thing yeah ultimately recommendation mean talked offline sort thinking loosely really sure thinking writing book kind desire go financial reasons money good way right mean power law type distributed right money hard cover somewhere one book thing personally give agent personally care money mentioned reason really like spending money things worth like care get money like spending money like feeding system inefficient like contributing problem biggest problem think worried inefficiencies yeah fact like overheads number people involved overheads emails fact way speaking allergic many people like marketing speak like could tell zoom meetings day like opposed sort creative collaborators like also little bit crazy yeah suppose finding right people finding right people would say say definitely maybe good fortune good fortune terms like agents editors worked really good people see vision smart incredibly literary actually help psychologically yeah great editor first moving hardcover books example first big book advance first sort big deal like senior editor useful like lot long talks right fourth book good ca ignore first big hardcover idea book lot talks like even started writing let talk books philosophy business long time head imprint useful yeah mean frustrating thing long whole thing takes takes long time yeah suppose accept yeah handed manuscript book comes like handed mean summer like pandemic terrible right editing pandemic finished spring talked today except little bit computer science today productive life love friendship family fit find tension possible relationships energize whole process benefit ultimately life short ultimately seek happiness productivity accept tension yeah mean think relationships whole deal like thought day know context thinking gon na give like advice speech like commencement address like giving advice young people like big question young people already bad things gon na happen control plan right like let start let start figuring know people get better others eventually stuff happens right get sick something falls apart economy craters someone know dies like sorts bad stuff gon na happen right gon na like like live life life hard ways unfair unpredictable relationships buffer wired right went rabbit hole digital minimalism went huge rabbit hole human brain sociality wired like brain like everything mechanisms everything made service social connections kept alive know mean tribal connections starve famine people would share food et cetera ca neglect like everything people feel right like social networks hooked pain center feels terrible miss someone like someone dies something right like seriously take pretty accepted theory default mode network like lot default mode network sort default state brain goes something particular practicing sociality practicing interactions thing crucial like core human thriving recently way think like relationships first okay given foundation putting like think put nearly enough time worry social media reducing relationships strong relationships strong relationships sacrificing time attention resources whatever behalf people net gon na allow get anything right wan na surplus remains maybe wan na build fire build tools put relationships first like worst case analysis computer science perspective put relationships first yeah everything else assuming average case assuming things kind keep going going neglecting fundamental human drive like talked boredom instinct wan na build things wan na impact wan na productivity nearly clear cut drive need people look real worst case analysis one day pretty young gon na last long gon na die one day something think little bit afraid death well mindset let make productivity hack mindset need confront soon let really confront think likely feel better words let focus living things way proud really comes time confront likely say okay feel kind good situation laying deathbed looking back would make think like oh okay proud optimized hell good question go backwards mean like david brooks eulogy virtues versus resume virtues right argument another interesting dc area person keep thinking interesting dc area people right david brooks argument thinks eulogy virtues eulogize different promote resume whole thing right second mountain wrote character books whole premise like professional phase phase giving sacrificing behalf people know maybe mixed together right wan na think living code important right mean something emphasized enough always think advice undergrad given given especially place like georgetown like deep history trying promote human flourishing jesuit connection resiliency pride comes living well even hard like living according code living according think religion used structure people absence need sort replacement even things soldiers get lot right experience lot even things tough able persist living way knew right even though easiest thing moment like fewer things give humans resilience like done relationships strong right many people come funeral standard like lot people gon na come funeral like mean matter lot people maybe done extent whatever capabilities happen granted know different different people people sprint real fast people math problems try actually something impact promise give gift cards anybody shows funeral gon na hack gon na hack even funeral gon na lottery wheel spin come someone goes away see problem like living principles living principle life focusing relationships kind thinking life perfect thing kind forgets notion none know makes sense right like like kind implies like video game wan na get high score opposed none even makes sense like would like like even mean die gon na like everything productivity hacks life efforts creative efforts kind assume gon na go forever kind sense immortality even know intellectually make sense ends course got ta ask context think meaning especially computer scientist mean got ta mathematical yeah douglass adams yeah okay better number read maybe onto something wan na give away much trust visible yeah mean know obviously right mean worth yeah know going back saying sort existentialist sort nihilist style approach one thing intimations right intimations human somehow feels right feels wrong feels good feels like aligned something acting courage save whatever right intimations grounding arbitrariness like one ideas really interested look religion right interested world religions grandfather like theologian studied wrote books interested type stuff great book specific particular religion karen armstrong wrote great book called case god interesting catholic nun sort left religion one smartest thinkers terms like accessible theological thinking tied particular religion whole argument way understand religion first go way back formed got messed thinking religion right operating systems making sense intimations like one thing different intimations field like awe mystical experience feels something feel act certain way act way like scientists trying study understand model atom looking experiments trying understand going like great religions world basically figuring make sense intimations live alignment build life meaning around tools using using ritual using belief using action like os like liturgical model atom evolutionary process something meant mean would called back yeah mean whether said said directive try live alignment well wan na ask wrote original code yeah open question yeah armstrong lays good argument gets really interesting emphasizes considered ineffable right whole notion like rich jewish tradition particular also islamic tradition ca comprehend understand going best approximate understanding live alignment act true rituals actions whatever lot got learned enlightenment grew suspicions around religion much modern era right like karen armstrong like sam harris critique religion makes sense right critiques based well making ascent propositions think true evidence true like enlightenment thing right context religion rutherford model atom like actually maybe underneath happening model explains chemical equations work like way religion god call works ritual act way aligns like model atom predicted na cl gon na become salt predicts gon na feel live alignment right like beautiful sophisticated theory actually matches lot great theologians thought come forward time yeah maybe evolution mean like peterson hints right like basically like get super pinned kinda seems almost like searching words focuses like jung people mean know jungian type analysis think roughly speaking like armstrong sort kind like peter sonian analysis looking deep history religion yeah throws evolutionary yeah wonder home finds wonder new home religion dissipates new home kinds natural inclinations whether technology evolution mean francis collins book also like well religious could religious notion know think stuff interesting religious person thinking bad idea maybe replaces honestly maybe replaces religion return religion sort sophisticated mean went back yeah mean issue lot recent critiques think strom critique complicated way whole way way works mean theologians reading paul tillich reading heschel reading people thinking sophisticatedly religion terms ineffable things connects us things way puts life alignment ca really explain going brains ca handle right average person though notion live kinda religions work live true like os getting alignment cultural evolution like behave way live true gives goal looking complicated thing live true especially theologian say yeah true alignment sense living kinda takes heat course people highly religious people still bad things really absolutely hell definitely gon na go bad thing would never one would ever murder anyone evangelical christian right like kind tangent shaky ground something interested lot well fast mean think sense searching make good operating system searching good live x true searching new x maybe artificial intelligence new gods desperately looking spit thought kel know huge fan

hopefully posted tomorrow monday november nd enjoy thing subscribe youtube review five stars apple podcasts follow spotify support patreon connect twitter lex friedman conversation charles isbell mentioned love movies tv shows let ask easy question definitively objectively conclusive top three movies time asking definitive conclusive little hard gon na tell simple movies broad category got ta pick tell genres pick one two genres get us three gon na cheat favorite comedy times probably favorite movie time girl friday probably movie ever heard based play called front page know early movie fantastic film story independent film talking one movies would popular screwball comedy ever see moonlighting tv show know talking seen shows man woman clearly love one another constantly fighting always talking bantor bantor bantor bantor bantor movie started far concerned much time know must come sometime sure exactly movie came black white fantastic film hilarious mostly conversation entirely mostly mostly lot back forth story someone death row newspaper men including newspaper men divorced editor publisher guess reporter divorced clearly thinking trying get back together whole thing going none matters plot matter yeah little play conversation fantastic love everything conversation end day sort narrative conversation sort things drive really like movie reason similarly gon na cheat gon na give two movies one crouching tiger hidden dragon john wick relatively modern john wick course one one two three one gets increasingly love different reasons increasingly ridiculous kind like loving alien aliens despite fact two completely different movies reason put crouching tiger hidden dragon john wick together actually think movie like movie create world coming middle explain story done well pick anyone seen john wick little coins headed rules apparently every single person new york city assassin like two people come otherwise complicated world everyone knows sit explain figure crouching tiger hidden dragon lot like get feeling chapter nine story missed first eight chapters gon na explain sort rich world behind love get pulled anyway get pulled anyway excellent storytelling cases different also like outfit assume john wick outfit oh yeah course course yes think john wick outfit perfect number two sorry pause martial arts long list hobbies like scrolls page see martial arts one martial arts certainly watch martial arts oh appreciate much oh could talk every jackie chan movie ever made would board like shower like kind comedy cop yes yes way favorite jackie chan movie would drunken master known states usually legend drunken master actually drunken master first one first kung fu movie ever saw know first jackie chan movie first one ever saw remembered idea know jackie chan like first major movie kid done later rediscovered actually creates martial art drinking actually drinking play drinking mean actor sure actor whatever definitely drinking end drinks industrial grade alcohol ah yeah yeah one fantastic fights ever anyway favorite one movies tell last movie actually movie called nothing man starred ivan dixon know hogan heroes abby lincoln really small little drama beautiful story favorite scene cheating favorite one favorite movies ending godfather think last scene fantastic whole movie summarized eight nine seconds godfather part one part one end think need worry spoilers seen godfather spoiler alert ends wife coming michael says let ask business asks terrible thing looks eye lies says says thank walks door see see going door people coming kissing michael hands godfather camera switches perspective instead looking looking door closes face end movie whole movie right see parallels position dean georgia tech krohn yes kidding trick question sometimes certainly door gets closed every okay rhetorical question also mentioned think enjoy kinds experiments including saw video said experiment tracked kinds information others sort wiring home little idea mentioned video kind interesting thought two days worth data enough capture majority behavior human first describe heck collect data fascinating like little details collect data also intuition behind two days first right two days thinking specific experiment actually suite part people done course sort dabbled part world clear specific thing talking recording ir going infrared going house long time ago everything curled pressing buttons remote controls opposed speaking alexa siri someone like trying figure could get enough data people figure gon na tvs lights house completely wired time know look movie turn tv whatever see could predict kind surprising easy way capturing little stuff mean bunch computer systems really easy capture know looking georgia tech long got thing called aware home everything wired captured everything going nothing even difficult video anything like way system capturing everything turns students worked many people turns end day people things right two days like weekend turns predict someone going next level button gon na press next remote control something really really simple like even need hidden mark model like mark simply press prediction next thing turns get accuracy something simple stupid counting statistics actually interesting could use information comes work try represent people objects things things measure action world distribution actions try represent distribution actions done pretty good job sort understanding people cluster remarkably well fact irritatingly clustering people way maybe know got accuracy next button gon na press get accuracy somewhere collections things might press turns things might press related number exactly would expect example key numbers keypad turns behavior respect human would naturally cluster together discover numbers related one another way things part think important mean see kinds things every individual different given individual remarkably predictable keep things two things learned long time thinking people easily predictable people hate tell easily predictable go let play devil advocate philosophically speaking possible say defines humans outlier even though large percentage behaviors whatever signal measure would cluster nicely maybe special moments break routine definitive things way break routine one us might different possible would say little differently think would make two things one gon na disagree premise think fine think way would put people different lots people closer right fact even kind clustering people turn small number people behave like even individually behave differently everyone else think kind important really asking think think really good question faced situation never seen faced extraordinary situation maybe seen others actually forced something react differently thing makes human would agree least philosophical level times faced something difficult decision make answer easy even know right answer sort defines individual think defines people broadly hard problem easy problem thing gon na hurt thing even difficult know outcome going highly suboptimal think reasonable place start question makes us human talk sort explore different ideas underlying interactive artificial intelligence working let go along thread skip kind world social media something least artificial intelligence side think popular narrative know true silos social media clusterings kind mentioning idea know along narrative know wan na break silos empathetic people democrat empathetic republican republican empathetic democrat two silly bins seem excited binnings think artificial intelligence perspective saying cluster along data interactive artificial intelligence referring throwing agents mix ai systems mix helping us interacting us humans maybe getting us silos something think possible see hopeful possibility artificial intelligence systems large networks people get us outside habits least idea space sort empathetic people lived experiences people points view know kind stuff yes actually think hard well hard sense imagine let make life simple minute let assume kind partial ordering ideas clusterings behavior even matter mean long way cluster cluster edge right kind quite touch even maybe come close imagine conceptually way get going way get find edge move slowly together right think machines actually good sort thing kind define problem either terms behavior ideas words whatever easy sense already network know relationships know edges sort strengths kind semantic meaning machine designer yeah think kind move people along sort expand harder reason harder sort coming network structure hard gon na tell story someone else told may get details little bit wrong roughly roughly goes like take two sets people backgrounds want solve problem separate time know know gon na break gon na break groups gon na go gon na talk gon na go gon na talk sort big room far apart one another sort interact one another come back talk learned wan na merge done together extremely hard basically speak language anymore like create problems dive create language example one person gave found kind interesting middle time sitting talking rooms see seeing different vantage points depending side room see clock easily start referring room one clock group looking room see clock line sight whatever end referring way get back together talking things referring room even realize referring room fact group even see clock group see whatever clock wall thing stuck create different silos problem ideologies disagree using words mean radically different things hard part getting agree well maybe say axioms world right get agree basic definitions right talking past completely talking past hard part getting meet getting interact may difficult getting see language leading lead past one another hard part really interesting question could layer language feels like multiple layers could worldview could mean boils empathy able put shoes person learn language learn visually see world learn mean experience trolls degree humor world example talk love lot lucky amazing community loving people whenever encounter trolls always roll eyes idea love quote unquote cringe yeah show love like derision would say think human level whole nother discussion psychology sociology wonder ai systems help somehow bridge gap person life like encourage ask question put shoes experience agitations fears hopes experience even think upbringing like like single parent home shitty education kinds things put mind space feels like really important us bring clusters together find similar language unclear ai help seems like ai systems need understand parties first word understand lot work right yes understand simply note something similar point touch right know use word empathy like word lot reasons think right way using way describing let separate sympathy right know sympathy feeling sort someone empathy kind understanding coming feel right people things go hand hand people good empathy bad sympathy people experience well observation would psychologist observation would people seem incapable feeling sympathy unless feel empathy first understand someone understand coming still think ca support right mean way case requires must way understand someone means must agree everything right right way feel someone completely understand make like way well lost right exactly like understand everything gone helps clearly separable ideas right even though get clearly tangled one another think ai could help actually know quite fanciful think kind understand interact words use actions take way let worry see kind distribution experiences actions taken upon things done someone else find places kind commonality mapping even total think distribution right take cosine angle zero got nothing common one completely person well know probably one almost certainly zero find place overlap might able introduce basis connect way make easier take step empathy impossible although wonder requires everyone involved least interested asking question maybe hard part getting interested asking question fact maybe get ask question alike different solve maybe problem ai working telling similar different getting decide worthwhile asking question feels like economist answer actually well people okay first people would disagree let disagree slightly think everything said brilliant tend believe philosophically speaking people interested underneath would say ai possibility ai system would show commonality incredible really good starting point would say social media could discover common things deep shallow person tension think basic human nature would take think enjoy commonality something sticky mind linger person mind become warmer warmer start feel compassion towards think majority population true might hypothesis yeah mean empirical question right figure mean want believe right gon na say think right course people come things purpose trolling right matter playing different game yeah know experiences requires two things requires fact maybe really end saying agree sure hard hold onto kind anger hold onto desire humiliate someone long difficult takes toll importantly know people done studies also experiences much easier dismissive person front real right much history world making people right social media web whatever internet forced deal someone person equivalent room makes huge difference one forced deal humanity front course might punch face go far things kind work together think right end think bringing people together really kind substitute forcing see humanity another person able treat bits hard troll someone looking eye difficult agreed broad set research interests fall interactive ai mentioned fascinating set ideas concrete things particularly interested maybe could talk think field interactive artificial intelligence sure let say upfront look certainly early work even look machine learning guy right machine learning first paper ever published nips back nips neurips long story anyway another thing machine learning guy right believe data believe statistics kind things yes reason bringing even though newfangled statistical machine learning guy long time problem really care ai right care artificial intelligence care building kind intelligent artifact however gets expressed would least intelligent humans interesting humans perhaps way deep underlying love dream bigger ai yes bigger whatever heck yeah machine learning ways means end end understand one could intelligent without learning therefore got ta figure right important machine learning way also tool said statistical people think machine learning people think think pat langley might disagree least pat langley might disagree takes machine learning care ai problem interactive ai interactive ml think important understand goal probably never live see would love part building something truly intelligent outside take tiny tangent interrupting something say concrete mysterious gap subset ml bigger ai missing think mean obviously totally unknown totally part unknown time something like pat langley knowledge like expert system reasoning type kind thing ai bigger ml ml bigger ai kind real problem really overlapping things really interested slightly different problems tend think ml many people gon na upset tend think ml much concerned engineering solving problem ai sort philosophical goal true intelligence thing motivates even end finding living kind space made michael jordan upset know feel different measuring differently sort goals trying somewhat different ai trying build intelligent thing typically always purpose understanding little bit better machine learning think trying solve problem whatever problem take others course would disagree note interactive ai tend mind visualize ai singular system collective huge amount systems interacting like social interaction us humans ai systems fundamental intelligence think well certainly fundamental kind intelligence right actually think matters quite bit reason interactive ai part matters gon na sound simple care whether tree makes sound falls one around think matters right observer sense think interesting way intelligent intelligent people right things anyway go way make things intelligent hardwired like find intention even whether intention anthropomorphize everything think anyway think interactive ai part intelligent isolation meaningless act sense correct answer intelligent way interact others also efficient allows learn faster import past history also allows efficient transmission ask intelligent clearly think also intelligent part larger species group people trying move species forward well think notion intelligent others kind key thing otherwise come go matter care aspect lots implications one building something intelligent others understanding ca always communicate others room clock wall seen means spend enormous amount time communicating one another constantly order figure wants mean people project project intentions reasons things others way understanding know behave way completely predictable person know predictable know well enough probably eat five things whatever know going new chinese restaurant get general gal chicken thing easy get get hot sour soup know people things people get chicken broccoli push analogy way far chicken know wrong people know wrong either good trauma get chicken broccoli egg drop soup whatever got ta communicate gon na change right interactive ai learning solve problem task adapt time long period time interacting people change mean things like adaptable models right model model gon na change way case different person different person minutes ago certainly years ago assume least gon na drift hopefully many discontinuities gon na drift time mechanism adapting individual time across individuals time topic adaptive modeling talk lifelong learning think topic understudied maybe nobody knows look alexa artificial intelligence systems primarily machine learning based systems dialogue systems kinds things know little sense lifelong learning sense learn humans learn lot quantity facts like temporally rich set information seems like pick crumbs along way somehow seems capture person pretty well ideas lifelong learning seems like machine learning community well way machine learning community spend lot time lifelong learning think spending lot time learning period sense tend task focused everybody overfitting whatever problem happen solutions task even people think people trying solve hard problem transfer learning gon na learn one task gon na learn task still end creating task like looking keys light light keys mean one could argue tend general tend kind group tend hill climb get stuck local optima think small well think hard look hard thing ai hard thing ai keeps changing us ai ai art science making computers act way movies good definition beyond keep coming new movies yes right exactly driven kind need ineffable quality means moment understand something longer ai well understand take derivative divide two average time window therefore longer ai problem unsolvable keeps kind going away creates kind illusion think entire illusion either simple things well engineer ai like nothing middle like hard get hard see get think done good job get stuck trying solve small problem front included gon na pretend better anyone else course incentives academia industry set make hard get next paper get next product solve problem sort naturally incremental none incentives set allow take huge risk unless already well established take big risk well established take big risk probably spent much career taking little risks relatively speaking got lifetime experience telling take particular big risk right whole system set make progress slow fine way make gap seem really big long way saying great answer except stop n equals one least try get n equal two maybe n equals seven say gon na maybe better variable gon na solve problem gon na solve problem another problem gon na learn gon na keep living world seeing happens learn something designers machine learning algorithms ai algorithms learn well unless willing build system gon na live months time environment messy chaotic control never going make progress direction guess answer yes idea yes deploying things making live months time okay fact gon na take five years rerunning experiment refining machine slightly better whatever actually living chaos world seeing learning algorithm say learn data structure build go without gon na stuck time think possibility n equals one growing probably crude approximation growing like look language models like make big enough swallow world meaning like solve infinity growing size taking small engineered solution pumping full steroids terms compute terms size training data jan lecun style open ai throw youtube learn reason paint create music love watching youtube videos mean ca think terrifying world live world based youtube videos yeah think answer kind think quite well wo work easily get somewhere learn something means probably worth wo get wo solve know thing build things say want learn actually happens let say learn mean certainly every paper gotten published things learn know anyone else actually change us right react differently right keep redefining means successful negative end case also positive oh well accomplishment give example like one described youtube let get completely machine learning well completely mostly machine learning think google people trying solve information retrieval ad hoc information retrieval problem forever mean first major book ever read think came anyway know treat everything vector vector space models whatever great made little progress mean made progress google comes makes ad hoc problem seem pretty easy mean lots computers databases involved know brilliant algorithmic stuff behind systems building problem changed right got world connected know million answers quite literally question asking problem give things relevant problem give anything irrelevant least first page nothing else matters google solving information retrieval problem least webpage google minimizing false positives thing getting answer turns good enough wan na use google also changes problem thought trying solve first place thought trying find answer trying find answer turns trying find answer yes true also good finding exactly webpage course trained figure keywords get webpage end much data changed problem something else actually learned set learn counter would maybe either think know heads maybe learning wrong problem first place think matters think point google solved information retrieval google done amazing service nothing bad say done lord knows entire life better google exists form google maps think would ever found place like see see go grateful google make certain first five things right everything wrong look going totally different topic think way hire faculty exactly thing getting controversial getting controversial exactly problem right minimizing false positives say things like wan na find best person assistant professor mit new college computing point founded years college computing part alma mater fighting words saying appreciate anyway gon na try hire best professor say best person job right know percentage faculty top four earn phds top four say recent year data maybe large percentage faculty top four earn phds top four computer science top five top four right tied one people know way would mit stanford berkeley cmu yep georgia tech number eight number eight keeping track oh yes large part job number five illinois number six tie uw cornell princeton georgia tech tied eight ut austin number michigan number way look top know percentage faculty top earn phds top roughly look top ranked departments faculty earn phds top universe best faculty even r universities majority come places way true especially consider small universities terms number phds produce negative mean negative also habit entrenching certain historical inequities accidents tells well ask question like well easier go way back saying nobody ever lost job buying computer ibm true nobody ever lost job hiring phd mit right person turned terrible well came mit expect know however person coming pick whichever least favorite place produces phds say computer science well took risk right insiders particularly gon na hire one year well hiring gon na hire one two three year way come stuck least seven years places know whether getting tenure get tenure stuck good years unless decide leave means pressure get right high gon na gon na minimize false positives care saying inappropriately care saying yes inappropriately pressure drives potential pressure drives particular direction google put fine point exactly situation search turns wan na give people wrong page first three four pages million right answers bazillion wrong answers make certain wrong answers get cares right answer actually th page right answer satisfying answer number one two three four cares answer make discover something beautiful profound question well different problem right problem linger topic without sort walking grace get hiring faculty get th page truly special person like mean depends department computer science probably department kinds people like russian guy gregory perlman like awkward strange minds know play little game etiquette faculty agreed somehow like converged decades play also know top top four top whatever numbers schools maybe actually says every traditions old within computer science community maybe talks trash machine learning total waste time resume like allow system give folks chance well willing take certain kind without taking particular position particular person take willing take risk right small amount risk mean treating well machine learning problem right search problem search problem treating way would say oh well main thing got prior want data cause bayesian wan na way inject randomness okay problem feels hard people incentives wrong turns let say right answer let give sake argument injecting randomness system level hire worth price high cost high infinite resources sure also got teach people ruining people lives get wrong taken principle even grant pushed way back right could better pool people look give opportunity better chance finding course pushes problem back another level let tell something else know sort study call study called eight friends asked data graduate admissions someone else followed actual study turns tell everybody gets grad school less less basically admit everyone places higher ranked admit people places ranked around meant almost one places ranked exception small liberal arts colleges ranked like harvey mudd phds ranked cs means decision whether know become professor cornell determined right knew go undergrad whatever right push things back little bit make pool little bit bigger least raise probability able see someone interesting take risk answer question way could argue either adjust pool probabilities go way injecting little bit uniform uniform noise system change loss function let measured something whatever measuring mean us news world report every time change formula determining rankings move entire universities behave differently rankings matter talk trash rankings second joking talking trash actually funny perspective shallow perspective dogmatic like much trust rankings almost ingrained head mean mit everybody kinda propagated mutually agreed upon idea rankings matter think anyone knows like people know based exactly based flaws well depends rankings talking wan na talk computer science gon na talk universities computer science us news main one yeah us news one matters us news nothing else matters sorry nothing else matters us news us news formula uses many things computer science computer science considered science absurd rankings computer science reputation two people department really department whatever department basically rank everybody slightly complicated whatever rank everyone things put together somehow rank means improve reputation move space reputation yes exactly question twitter help tell georgia tech least think georgia tech georgia tech actually case look georgia tech georgia tech computing unit top made top also one last two decades think moved top opposed someone else move used number became number nine ut austin went slightly retired ninth rankings work moved nine eight raw score moved point something georgia tech computer science computing anyway think shown leadership every crisis level right created college first public university second college second university cmu number one also think accident cmu largest depending upon count depending exactly mit ends final college computing second third largest think accident long time crisis undergraduate education georgia tech took big risk succeeded rethinking undergrad education computing think created schools time public universities anywhere afraid online masters mattered people trying figure moocs think observed peers impact mean reputation right way move reputation rankings something makes people turn look say good better thought beyond inertia huge histories system right mean ca remember may apocryphal major department mit ranked number one right know true someone said anyway thing right reputation course mit great mit great always great way mit great best students come keeps great mean positive feedback loop surprising think wrong yeah almost like narrative like actually backed reality say anything mit like feel like playing space narratives space something grounded like one surprising things showed mit students worked research done like people met places mean mit going well mit many things going one things mit going nice logo nice logo lot better nice colors terrible terrible name mascot thing mit going really get best students get best students many best students right best students wan na best place one best place kind sort positive event said something earlier think worth examining moment right said forget word used said living space narrative opposed something objective narrative objective mean one could argue thing humans narrative build stories explain someone asked wait nothing objective completely objective measure objective measure opinions everybody else physics know know mean tell something think actually objective measurable way makes sense like cameras know mean getting something know cameras reflecting light putting film like work dark skinned people like know building cameras people gon na buy cameras least united states western europe relatively light skinned turns took terrible pictures people look like got fixed better film whole processes know furniture manufacturers wanted able take pictures mahogany furniture right candy manufacturers wanted able take pictures chocolate reason bring might think cameras objective objective capturing light made things based upon decisions real human beings privilege may use word physics others engineering problem right either worry part spectrum part spectrum costs costs less costs people paying money right turns giant conglomerate wants demands something different gon na involve kinds money suddenly change right go actually know ended oh notion objectiveness right even objective objective end got ta tell story got ta make decisions got ta make else engineering think rankings capture something necessarily capture people assume capture know linger idea people like play whatever narrative fun like excite world whether carl sagan style like calm sexy voice explaining stars romantic stuff elon musk dare even say donald trump like trolling shaking system saying controversial things like talked lisa feldman barrett neuroscientist enjoys playing controversy things like finds counterintuitive ideas particular science throws sees play public discourse like see academia attract get elon musk type well tenure powerful thing allows whatever want getting tenure typically requires relatively narrow right people judging well think answer told story narrative vulgar described vulgar certainly unscientific right easy convince ways mathematician right fewer major proves purity right yeah tell story beneath kind thing right think wrong think way everyone everyone good everyone even would good would enjoy fine think need diversity way people choose relate world academics think great universities ones engage rest world home public intellectuals public intellectual probably means twitter whereas course true years ago twitter around years ago around meaningful way actually know long twitter around get older find notion time gotten worse worse like google really around long anyway point think sometimes forget part job impact people world point great place great person frankly interesting force terms public intellectuals get twitter look online courses public facing part like kind force pulls back would let call give damn point little bit us certainly faculty jealousy whoever popular good communicator exciting world science course excite world science peer reviewed clean sounds like bullshit like ted talk people roll eyes hate ted talk gets millions views something like everybody pulls back force kinda hard stand unless like win nobel prize whatever like like get senior enough stop giving damn like said even get tenure always surprising thing many colleagues friends gotten tenure switch f money switch like know going bold see well reason tenure test training process teaches behave certain way think certain way accept certain values react accordingly better likely earn tenure way bad thing things like think colleagues interested great work impact way wan na impact think field field profession habit belittling popular word kind scarlet right think easy convince one immune people better known better known bad reasons people dumbing pure whatever values ethos field easy said think ultimately people able popular touching world making difference colleagues fact appreciate long run good interested pursuing get past certain level think people accept mean know really interested rod brooks felt people interacting fast cheap control way way way back fast cheap control documentary involved four people remember nothing rod brooks something naked mole rats ca remember two things robots naked mole rats two way rod brooks used head artificial intelligence laboratory mit launched think irobot think robotics rethink robotics yes yes think word also little bit rock star personality ai world opinionated intelligent anyway sorry mole rats naked naked mole rats also one two advisors phd explains lot know explain love rod also love advisor paul paul listening love different people paul viola paul viola interesting people different many ways know rod would say reaction know students time student time amazing right guy movie much actually movie version little bit rod rod think edited appropriately much rod great work mean running ai lab point know anyway running ai lab would soon giant field amazing things made lot bones kind counterintuitive science right saying wrong representation crazy world representation react mean amazing things continues sorts things moved think might tell know would tell good bad know everyone else world good thing certainly continued respected destroyed career popular right let go topic thin ice grew soviet union russia knowledge music american thing guys quite foreign research group called talked lab interactive artificial intelligence also bunch mystery around research fails also called pfunk p stands probabilistic funk stand lot life making acronyms one quirk people say words see make acronyms happy try change make acronyms thing pfunk acronym three four different meanings finally decided p stands probabilistic end day machine learning randomness uncertainty important thing funk lots different things decided leave individual figure exactly tell students graduate get say tech hand put hat star glasses medallion pfunk era take picture hand pair fuzzy dice get keep sense acronym like literally funk dark mysterious past oh dark fun hip hop funk yep educate soviet born russian thing called hip hop like give like know went journey together trying educate especially know past couple decades hip hop funk records artists would introduce would well would tell maybe influenced journey love like family gone sit back blast stuff days listen well listen lot tell well first great music made statement true people matter old live first thing worth pointing hip hop rap thing depending talk people feel strongly much stronger offending everybody conversation great let keep going hip hop culture yeah agree whole set things rap part tagging part hip hop know true people tell true willing go along get angry hip hop tagging like graffiti tagging like graffiti including popping locking dancing things part hip hop way life think true rap music part yes music part stuff yeah mean would call stuff djs scratching rap right part hip hop right given understand hip hop whole thing rap albums best touch well gon na educate would try figure liked would work oh god well would probably start um one okay fascinating exercise one watching old episodes love love love bunch friends see people come pop culture talking people would actually start would hope start anyway public enemy particularly takes nation millions hold us back clearly best album ever produced certainly best hip hop album ever produced part much great time fantastic lyrics excuse lyrics amazing music coming rick rubin producer lot kind heavy least sense time focused politics made hip hop great would start would move things happening recently probably get someone like def would give history lesson basically def amazing hosted poetry jam thing hbo something like probably think seen would surprised yeah spoken poetry kind stuff yes amazing amazing would got work back epmd eventually would take back last poets particularly first album last poets give sense history actually building long time would start music aligns would cycle move present take back past think large part people kind confused kind music truth thing always talking right narrative part something immersed something understand right jazz also like one things cool jazz come meet someone talking jazz idea talking one day clicks immersed go oh yeah charlie parker start using words nobody else understands right becomes part hip hop way everything way cultural artifacts would help see history connects genres music might like bring could kind see connects already like including good work done fusions hip hop bluegrass oh yes even good good start takes nation whole back interesting tradition modern hip hop integrating almost like classic rock songs whatever integrating music beat whatever kind interesting gives whole new classic rock kanye gold digger old r b taking pulling old r b right well true since beginning mean fact ways dj used get top billing dj brought records together made worth people could dance go back days mostly new york though exclusively mostly new york sort came dj brought music together beats showed basically music instrument meta bring together sort wrap sort moved way going way way back period time grew became really mostly funk back lot stuff public enemy time notwithstanding nice tied parents listened vaguely remember listening small way complete revival george clinton parliament funkadelic things bring sort back go gon na see know last decade decade brought think hearing something heard probably sampled someone referring something remembered young perhaps somewhere else altogether realize popular song happen grow stuff going long time one things think beautiful run dmc jam master jay used play played piano would record playing piano sample make part going rather play piano mind think well pieces putting pieces together putting pieces music together create new music right mean roots mean roots thing yeah whole yeah still right attitude know else jazz right jazz putting pieces together putting spin thing thing know mentioned lyrics make sad talking trash modern hip hop like know investigated sure people correct lot great artists part reason saying leave comments listen person lyrics went away talking maybe politics life like know kind like protest songs even look like bob marley said public enemy rage machine rock side place go lyrics like classic rock like woman left really happy still flip side like love songs different kinds love less political like less interesting would say terms like deep profound knowledge seems like rap place would find sad part see like look like mumble rap whatever moving away lyrics towards beat musicality always fan lyrics fact go back read reviews recently reading man fuck wrote last review month graduated got phd says something something sure though always would always often would start lyrics lyrics someone already written comments even finished conversation neither us knows talking underground hip hop go listen true every time despair popular rap someone points discover underground hip hop song made happy whole know listen much used listening podcasts old music kind beat little bit sampling sure way james brown funk yes junior wells way oh junior wells chicago blues james brown james brown hard imagine somebody james brown go look hoodoo man blues junior wells listen snatch back hold see contemporaries put little richard kind stuff like ray charles get hit road jack come back like funkiness oh definitely funkiness mean line line carries together guess would answer question depending whether thinking thinking probably give different answer thinking terms rock look back funky use words maybe around think used word funk certainly way used reject disco reject disco appreciate mistakes made get actually disco actually really really good john travolta oh boy regrets probably maybe well mistakes thing yeah got going oh well thank taking detour talked computing already talked computing little bit try describe think world computing fits sets different disciplines mentioned college computing think computing especially educational perspective perfect curriculum defines young mind computing know perfect curriculum although important question end day without curriculum get anywhere curriculum fundamental data structure even classroom true love world different right think curriculum like play spend lot time thinking answer question answering slightly different question first getting back talked disciplines mean discipline truth really educate people beginning certainly college sort failed think way think world people often think tools tool sets really trying good think skills skill sets disciplines mindsets right fundamental ways thinking hammer pick whatever hit nail skill learning hammer well whatever mindset fundamental way think world right disciplines different disciplines give different mindsets give different ways sort thinking mind think computing even ask question whether discipline decide mindset way thinking world different scientist discovery using scientific method way mathematician builds abstractions tries find sort steady state truths abstractions may artificial whatever engineer building demonstrably superior technology respect notion whatever means right sort world live computing computing different thought long time come view computing actually mindset little abstract would appropriate computing think distinguishes computationalist others understands models languages machines equivalent thing model machine executable thing described language means dynamic mathematical sense kind sense abstraction fundamentally dynamic executable mathematician necessarily worried either dynamic part fact whenever tried write something mathematicians invariably demand make static bad thing way viewing world truth thing right process continually runs right dynamic thing matters system matters computing brought us science models fundamentally represent truths world information scientific thing discover right mathematical conceit gets created course engineering actually dealing constraints world trying execute machines actually run also math actually worrying languages describe happening fact regular expressions finite state automata one feels like machine least abstraction machine language actually equivalent thing mean small thing permeates everything even trying figure debugging idea think fundamental would better made explicit life changed thinking years since tried put paper colleagues realization comes question actually asked earlier trees falling whether matters sort triangle equality matters person inside triangle right changed computing computer science whatever wan na call much data much computational power able really really interesting promising things interesting promising kind matters respect human beings relationship triangle exists fundamentally computing makes worthwhile interesting potentially world species changing human beings inside intelligence interact changes data information makes sense gives meaning models languages machines curriculum convey conveying tools skills need order succeed big win think pull psychology human things idea framework computing pull psychology neuroscience like parts psychology parts neuroscience parts sociology philosophy like studies human nature different perspectives absolutely way works ways let take biology moment turns cell basically bunch statements look right way nice understand statements never really enjoyed biology understand statements tell biologist begin understand actually helps think bunch really cool things still biology involved whatever hand fact biology fact cell bunch statements whatever allows computationalists think differently language way well certainly way would ai machine learning even way think computation important thing engineering colleagues computer science worry computer science eating engineering colleges computer science trapped worry worry computing computer science computing central important thing world important key helping others cool things gon na gon na historian gon na get phd history without understanding data science computing way gon na get history done part say done way gon na get done going look data gon na let gon na system gon na help analyze things help think better way describe history understand going tells us might going true psychology true things reason brought philosopher lot say computing psychologist lot say way humans interact computing right certainly lot intelligence ultimately kind goal building computational devices build something intelligent think computing eat everything certain sense almost like disappear part everything funny say wan na say gon na metastasize kind two ways fields destroy one become super narrow think think fields might way become pure instinct impulse sure think several people want computer science pure thing way become everywhere become everything nothing everyone says know gon na teach fortran engineers whatever gon na lose thing makes worth studying thing computing unique computing though point time distinctive computing happen thriving major fact thriving major almost every place service unit people need know things need know job much mathematician job help person think like mathematician much way point taking chemistry freshman learn chemistry learn think like scientist right job help think like computationalist take things seriously sure field historically certainly taken second thing job help think certain way people gon na major think taken seriously know know dan carlin podcast called hardcore history amazing conversation mostly hitler bring talks idea possible history field become like currently people study history little bit kind aware conversation different parts mean lot criticism say parts history ignored blah blah blah people able curiosity able learn thought possible given way social media works current way communicate history becomes niche field literally people ignore everything happening fast history starts losing meaning starts thing like theoretical computer science part computer science becomes niche thing rare holders world wars history founding united states kinds things civil wars kind profound thing think lose track lose fields best like case history best pervasive thing everybody learns thinks would say computing quite obviously similar history sense seems like part everybody life degree especially move later parts st century obvious way go might hands still like depending machine learning unclear computing win currently successful would say something mean leadership level defining future hands pressure like feels like multiple ways go kind conversation everybody learn code right changing nature jobs sense role education computing like hopeful path forward lot say well first would absolute shame one studied history hand approaches infinity amount history presumably also growing least linearly forget history history needs always mean imagine world think brains outside head kind learn history need know need know seems fanciful kind way sufficient statistic history certainly may particular thing care remember objective camera discussion right yeah right already lost lots history course history even lost right even remember whatever years ago yeah gone exactly history lost anyway big lessons history think take question computing sort education point get across lessons get across way thinking able go back wan na lose data even necessarily information fingertips computing think somewhat different everyone learn code everyone needs learn think way precise mean precise sense repeatable sense resolution sense get right number bits saying want machine able describe problem way executable human beings good fact think spend much time talking back forth kind vaguely understand person means hope get good enough act accordingly ca machines least yet think precisely things quite important somewhat different coding coding crude means end hand idea coding means programming language sort things fiddle ways express incredibly important point fact would argue one big holes machine learning right ai forget basically software engineering forget using programming like using languages express get caught deep network get caught whatever forget know making decisions based upon set parameters made slightly different parameters completely different outcomes lesson computing computer science education able think like aware basically end day way surfacing assumptions mean call parameters know call statements whatever forced surface assumptions key key thing get computing education models languages machines equivalent actually follows explicit trying model building something one day run better get right least understand able express roughly want express think key figure educate everyone think way end would make better whatever emphasize also make better citizens help understand others react accordingly gon na solve problem social media insofar think social media problem making slightly better code right works people react appropriately know happening therefore take control mean take okay let try proceed awkwardly topic race okay one fascinating part story eloquent fun second living pretty tense time terms race tensions discussions ideas time america grew atlanta born atlanta southern state somewhere tennessee something like nice okay early moved basically identify atlanta native yeah mentioned grew predominantly black neighborhood way black african american personal color prefer black black capital capital letters rest matter capital okay predominantly black neighborhood almost see race maybe correct video talked showed georgia tech undergrad one black folks like oh new experience take human perspective also race perspective journey growing atlanta showing georgia tech oh

girlfriend girlfriend even entirely sure girls first grade remember decided girlfriend little white girl named heather long discussion okay us boyfriend girlfriend despite fact white black two parents two us parents know yes girlfriend boyfriend first grade basically meant spent slightly time together recess think eskimo kissed mean hardly anything time felt scandalous everyone watching like ah

found lots students met people atlanta either black white nothing else began meet students asian descent met students would call hispanic forth know world college supposed right supposed open people strange thing minority came boston tell story applied one place undergrad georgia tech stupid know better know better right one told went grad school applied three places georgia tech mit cmu got mit got cmu friend went cmu asked thought spent time explaining pittsburgh much less cmu pittsburgh developed strong opinion based upon strong opinion something sun coming two days year get chance go timing wrong think timing wrong mit asked people knew either visited already known variety reasons whether liked boston loved hated loved white hated black explained much case deaths told stories remarkably two clusters came could see immediately people would love people would people tell nice coffee shops well coffee shops cd used cd places yeah kind thing nice shops oh students harvard square beautiful things walk something outdoors slight bit interested outdoors bugs humans yeah mean way feel black folk told completely different stories part town wan na caught dark heard nothing new decided mit great place university believed believe whatever wanted thought knew wanted wrong someone would know course would pick one topic nobody working time okay great thought would fine like four five years told turned true enjoyed time enjoyed time see lot ran across lot things driven look like got asked lot questions ran lot cops saw lot city time mean long time things remember single black radio station know radio stations anymore sure listen radio anymore almost one least certain age idea could major metropolitan area single black radio station mean radio station played would call black music absurd somehow captured kind everything city grew atlanta heard tell atlanta boston economically viable socially cohesive black middle class insofar existed uniformly distributed

different experience places whether rich whether poor could black rich black poor places segregated class well race existed least feel way felt like bunch really interesting contradiction felt like interesting contradiction interracial dating capital country really felt way also felt like racist place ever spent time could go orange line time mean years ago know like places could go knew everybody knew places could live everybody knew greater boston area saddle racism explicit racism terms within institutions feel levels empowered first one first black people particular discipline great institutions part georgia tech mit part felt limiting always felt empowered delusion think worked never felt fact quite opposite feel one trying stop distinct impression people wanted succeed people meant people power fellow students want succeed felt supported least people happy see succeed least much anyone else dealing different set problems early least computer science early jackie

something like somewhere around far away first first still another eight years away first black phd computer science right sort interesting time feel institutions university furthermore felt enough critical mass across institute students probably faculty know wanted make certain right thing happened different institutions rest city think designed way felt need supportive let ask touchy question kind said feel felt empowered lesson advice sense matter feel empowered said used word think illusion delusion sense individual perspective always kind ignore know ignore eyes ignore little forces able observe around like trying mess whether jealousy whether hatred pure form whether hatred like deluded form kind stuff kind see empowered confident kinds things mean certainly helps trade right deluded enough think succeed mean ca get phd unless crazy enough think invent something one else come mean kind massive delusion deluded enough believe succeed despite whatever odds see front ca deluded think need step way oncoming train right trade right kind believe helps support group around way another able find able find wherever gone even necessarily floor lots friends many still live kept many felt supported certainly mother family people back home could always lean back even long distance call cost money something kids today even know talking back mattered calling mom expensive proposition fine think helps deluded miss obvious makes things slower makes think better hurt long run mentioned cops tell story pulled perhaps happened sure one could tell story general give sense world looks like law always look blank slate objective eyes know say poetically well guess either guess answer looks exactly way looks world happen live right people clustering things making decisions based one two bits information find relevant way positive feedback loops makes easier believe believed behave certain way makes true goes circles cycles cycles cycles edge despite made congratulations brother thank god gray hairs pretty good think know imagine ever see police officer get tense everyone gets little tense probably means pulled speeding something gon na get ticket whatever right mean interesting thing law general human beings experience fundamentally negative right dealing lawyer trouble except small circumstances right underlying reality imagine also hands police officer remember time got pulled time halfway boston wellesley actually remember thinking pulled gun shot right shot right get away worst thing felt particular moment shoots get away would years later realized actually much worse get away anyone became thing people knew odds would course would became thing people knew living today world opposed world years ago would get away would painted villain probably big scary probably moved fast done said da da da da da da da somehow worse right know hurts dead family way people look look legacy history terrible would work absolutely believe would worked done think wanted shoot think felt like killing anybody go night expecting planning would surprised never ever ever even pulled gun know man name remember anything remember gun guns big face tell much much larger seem basically like speeding something like said ran light think ran light sure think ran light know fact may even gotten ticket may gotten warning think little spooked pulled gun yeah apparently moved fast something rolled window unclear think thought gon na something least behaved take little walk around brain feel guy feel cops experience well remember guy views police officers view lots things fire important necessary thing world must respect fire burn fire necessary evil sense burn necessary sense know heat things use fire see cop see giant ball flame try avoid people might see nice place nice thing roast marshmallows family fine roast marshmallows okay let go little darker apologize talked dan carlin four hours sorry go dark little bit easy experience careful fire avoiding turn hatred yeah course one might even argue illogical conclusion hand got live world think helpful hate something takes lot energy one reserve useful carry around time big difference happy delusion convinces actually get bed make work today without getting hit car sad delusion means worry car barreling towards little deluded otherwise paralyzed one ridiculous go way back something said earlier empathy think would ask people get one many many many stories recognize real people would ask empathize police officer would quote back statistics saying police officer even top dangerous jobs united states much likely get killed taxi cab half police officers actually killed suicide means lives something something going would happy empathetic go see world think though step back feel step back individual police officer feels step level things tie back interactive ai real problem built narrative built big structure made easy people put different pots different clusters basically forget people clusters ultimately like useful exercise ask sometimes think grown completely different house completely different household completely different person woman would see world differently would believe crazy person believes answer probably yes believe fundamentally possibly fix fix twitter think twitter needs broken facebook think facebook broken fix racism fix things structural right mean individual conversations matter lot create structures allow people individual conversations time way relatively safe allows understand people different experiences ultimately sounds even know right word trying avoid word like saccharine feels optimistic think okay think part delusion wan na little optimistic recognize hard problem actually setting structures first place almost one interest change infrastructure right tend believe leaders big role selling optimistic delusion everybody eventually leads building structures requires leader unites everybody vision opposed divides vision particular moment history feels like probability go p something akin violent civil war one divisive periods american history recent speak perhaps knowledgeable deeper perspective naive perspective seems like strange time lot anger people mean many reasons one thing spoken think much quiet economic pain millions like growing covid closed businesses like lost dreams building whatever tension building seems elevated level emotion sure psychoanalyze coming sort protests percolated like particular moment history oh enough time passed mean first race riots boston draw anything really oh late going way mean like whatever right mean massive one new york mean talking way way way back boston used hotbed riots boston told history class interesting one new york remember anyway point basically got ta get another generation old enough angry old remember happened last time right yeah sort happens said like two completely said two things think worth unpacking one sort moment time sort built kind sort economic reality covid actually want separate things example happened covid happened let separate two things moment let preface saying although interested history one three minors undergrad history specifically history interesting spanish okay mistake oh love okay history spanish spanish history actually spanish would call cognitive science time oh fascinating interesting minored cogs eye grad school really fascinating different experience computer science classes taking even cogs eye classes taking undergrad anyway interested history hardly historian right forgive ask audience forgive simplification think question always worth asking opposed question little different right civil rights movement opposed well first civil rights movement character quite well known war ii lots interesting things happening switch turned brown versus board education montgomery bus boycott happened things building forever go way back way back way back harriet tubman born right take things could easily happened right world war ii yes think scholar think big difference tv things visible people see hard avoid right james farmer martin luther king one born years whatever think turns know king biggest failure early days georgia know usual thing trying integrate forget guy name look cop sheriff made deal whole state georgia gon na take people going put trucks going take put jails far away gon na gon na reason press hang around worked press left nothing changed next went birmingham alabama bull got see tv little boys girls hit fire hoses knocked outrage things changed right part delusion pretending nothing bad happening might force something big want sometimes gets put face kind ca ignore large part view happened right public ignore created ways ignoring lots change happened south part delusion gon na affect west northeast course caused set problems went late ways living legacy happening happen years ago think people voices tv social media easy things kind build things quite visible demographic change mean world changing rapidly right difficult seeing people could avoided seeing life growing particular time happening dispersing speed fast enough cause concern people fast cause massive negative reaction hand massive oversimplification think something anyway least something worth exploring happy yelled real historian oh yeah mean obvious thing mean guess implying saying mean seemed percolated single video example george floyd video makes difference makes fascinating think whatever mechanisms put injustice front face like like directly front face mechanisms mechanisms change yeah hand rodney king one remembers seem person remembers sometime rodney king incident guy police officer saying things really bad southern california gon na prove news camera people follow around says gon na go towns follow week see get harassed like first night goes crosses city cops pull police officer remember know course like shove face glass window news distinctly remember watching kid actually guess kid college grad school time enough like well disappeared day later go viral whatever whatever magic thing whatever harder go viral right actually must happened like two days later like never happened like nobody nobody remembers like person sometimes think must dreamed anyway rodney king happens goes viral moral equivalent thereof time eventually get april th right know difference two things one thing caught one thing maybe happening two things feeding onto one another one people willing believe easier easier ways give evidence yeah cameras body cams still finding telling story thing would invite go back read people saying violence right answer rodney king go back big riots happening around read words mean remembering history right mean like literally words like could caught surprised one got flagged plagiarism interesting opinion question violence popular perhaps caricature malcolm x versus king martin luther king know malcolm x older martin luther king people kind head younger well died sooner right years right people think mlk older statesman think malcolm x young angry whatever narrative device true reject choice think false choice think things happen said hatred takes lot energy know every fight one thing say without taking moral position take matter violence worked yeah annoying thing annoying thing seems like top anger works outrage works say like calm rational talking gon na lead progress seems like look history irrationally upset way make progress well certainly way get someone notice yeah notice mean difference without taking moral position trying observe history maybe television exist civil rights movement happen takes longer takes different form maybe social media exist whole host things positive negative happen right things expose things people violence way shouting mean many people far talented thoughtful said one form another right violence voice unheard right mean thing people feel option sometimes agree sometimes disagree sometimes think justified sometimes think regardless way shouting shout people tend hear even necessarily hear words saying hear shouting see way another way putting think less let us say provocative think true change particularly change impacts power particularly change impacts power requires struggle struggle violent struggle nonetheless powerful give power easily mean even still struggle way violent political whatever nonviolent political change right true understanding calculus right mean everything requires struggle back talking faculty hiring end day comes faculty hiring metaphor faculty hiring metaphor life let ask strange question think everything gon na okay next year hope gon na okay tend think everything gon na okay tend think everything gon na okay mother says something lot always find quite comforting shall pass shall pass shall pass bad thing going away everything passes mean daughter going go college probably minutes given fast seems growing get hang one day wo ignore much ignored parents college went grad school shall pass think one day lucky live long enough look back something happened ago even painful mostly memory yes think okay humans think live st century certainly hope worried might destroy nuclear weapons agi engineering worried agi worried mean given moment right also given moment comic mean whatever tend think outside things completely beyond control better chance making know talked alex villapenca berkeley talking comets come nowhere realization wow watching darkness enter less month yet make day day one shall pass well maybe earth pass humans choosing believe going okay gon na get hit asteroid least around well little might well assume going happen makes food taste better makes food taste better millions things done life also began week black history calendar facts like million questions ask said historian let start big history question somebody history black history draw lot philosophical personal inspiration find interesting moment history find interesting well find entirety civil rights movement happen happen time quite inspirational mean read quite bit time period least younger days time read many things wanted quirky week black history started focused sources stealing much stealing sort like take calendars anything could find google exist right pulled much could put together one place people ended quirky started getting people sending information inventors people know garrett morgan benjamin banneker right people inventing things time world manage invent anything like things happening mother necessity right things happening many terrible things happening around went wrong state wrong time may never come back inventing things use right always inspiring people would still create even circumstances got lot also learned lessons think know charles richard drews world know create things impact people necessarily get credit right also okay okay point yeah mean look world really credit always bothered much value credit given thing got mean academic sense thing got feels way sometimes got actual gon na dead soon got joy created know credit talked jørgen schmidhuber right turing award given three people deep learning could say lot people list nobel prize question yeah sad sad people like talking feel like long arc history person remembered einstein hitler maybe elon musk rest us like well know someone asked immortality said stole somebody else remember know asked great grandfather name course know us know mean entirely sure know grandparents names grandparents names know called right know middle names example within living memory could find actually grandfather know born idea old right definitely know great grandparents sense immortality something preferably positive great grandchildren know right kind hope depressing ways could turn something uplifting need yeah work yeah simple right matter know great grandfather know would without know great grandchildren certainly great great grandchildren probably never meet although would much like hopefully set world motion way lives better would done well certainly would existed done things think good positive thing live people afraid death know afraid death like another mean ponder think inevitability oblivion yes occasionally feels like rushing conversation actually yeah tell story something happened recently look carefully see scar yes way interesting story people half thyroid taken people get scars anyway half thyroid taken way got way interesting story wo go suffice say keep telling people never never go doctor unless nothing good ever gon na come doctor visit right went doctor look one thing little bump side thought might something bad mother made went like oh nothing way thyroid huge breathe yes breathe sure pushing windpipe dead ah right ended going look thyroid growing called goiter said gon na take point sometime probably wait till really bad wan na surgery years old help certainly kind surgery takes take thyroid went would decide would put december th birthday december th wanted able say made whatever said wait till birthday first six months nothing changed apparently next three months grown noticed went surgery took half half still working fine way take pill anything like great hospital room doctor comes got things arm gon na whatever talking anesthesiologist says huh blood pressure roof high blood pressure said terrified helps anesthesist nurse supports anesthesiologist got right said oh worry put stuff iv gon na feeling pretty good couple minutes remember turning saying well gon na feel pretty good couple minutes next thing know guy moving bed talking distinct impression met guy know talking kind remember happened look see tiles going like oh like movies see tiles go brief thought infinitely long warehouse someone sitting next remember thinking oh talking back hospital bed time tiles going got hospital bed something like five hours passed apparently grown much four half hour procedure instead hour long procedure lost neck size half pretty big apparently big heart telling telling hell story already tiles going waking hospital bed time passed sensation time passed go sleep wake morning feeling time passed feeling something physically changed nothing happened time put magic juice time woke nothing way wife talking apparently also talking remember luckily say anything would normally say memory would talk would teleport around room accused witchcraft end point view would start talking would fall asleep would wake leave notion time passing kind imagine death yeah lack sensation time passing one hand know soothed idea wo notice hand unhappy idea wo notice know afraid death completely sure like particularly would prefer discover whether immortality sucks able make decision would prefer like choice matter would like choice matter well russian thing think finiteness thing gives little flavor little spice well reinforcement learning believe discount factors otherwise matter amen well let one last question sticking russian theme talked great grandparents remembering name think kind markov chain life think meaning meaning life well world eventually wo know great grandchildren reminded something heard read really like well worth remembering entire universe say one trifling exception composed entirely others think meaning life charles one best conversations ever get see tomorrow hang looks one say interesting personalities ever get meet michael lidman ca wait excited opportunity

things together let rewind back movie book shows profound impact philosophically specifically something enjoyed nerding yeah interesting think lot us inspired robots movies one really like movie called robot frank think really interesting future robots deployed helpers people homes know make robots like point seemed plausible seemed realistic imaginable thought really cool awkward funny things raise interesting issues seemed like something would ultimately helpful good could right yeah older cranky gentleman older cranky jewel thief yeah kind funny little thing jewel thief pulls robot life something could imagine taking home robotics thing pulling whatever quirky thing involved existence meaningful exactly yeah think perspective us jewel thieves bring robots speak yeah explains lot apartment actually idea people ability make technology becomes part lives think hard us technologists make kind technology easier mold people need opposite vision think really inspiring anthropomorphization project certain things think robot kind dumb bunch roombas play immediately project stuff onto much greater level intelligence probably much greater degree compassion right one things learning ai smart smart yeah also enjoy people see enjoyed watching sing even dance little bit little bit dancing little bit dancing quite thing method education life general easy question definitive objectively speaking top three songs time maybe something walk back little bit maybe something others might surprised three songs kind enjoy great question answer instead let tell story pick question want answer right watching presidential debates vice presidential debates turns yeah answer question want let say let interrupt related question yeah well said really like pop music enjoyed pop music ever since young music music music awesome kids think stopped listening music starting realize musical taste sort frozen decided think start listening top billboard songs week treadmill would listen week top songs could find popular discovered musical taste whatsoever like familiar first time hear song first week charts like second week little bit third week loving fourth week like part afraid ca tell favorite song time whatever heard recently yeah interesting people told art listening music well start listen song carefully explicitly force really listen start part jazz band fusion band college start hear layers instruments start hear individual instruments listen classical music orchestra way listen jazz way mean funny imagine walk forward listening pop hits like scholar listening like cardi b something like justin timberlake timberlake bieber top since listening still oh god cool heard justin timberlake top last years one song music video set essentially nurips oh wow oh one robotics yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like academic conference demo sort cross apple like steve jobs kind talk nurips know always fun ai shows pop culture wonder consulted somebody really interesting maybe topic seen um celebrity multiple dimensions one done cameos different places seen turbotax commercial like guess brilliant einstein character point turbotax need somebody like need brilliant person things need someone like yes specifically emphasizing idea need like computer expert able use software end world think interesting story teaching class intro computer science class uh sometimes people would visit campus would check say hey want see class like sit class uh person came class daughter brother husband best friend wife anyway basically family friend came campus check brown asked come class came dad dad uh known various kinds family events forth also advertising said recruiting scientists ad turbotax set ads said wrote ad idea get like brilliant researchers um said help us find b level scientists like sure hang fine put together list people call dictainee included list possible candidates uh know little blurb one thought would make sense reached handful ultimately youtube stalked little bit thought oh think could um said okay going offer commercial like um interesting experience another world people like nationwide kind ad campaigns television shows movies forth quite remarkable system going set yeah went uh somebody house rented new jersey um commercial woman reality people room another know half dozen kind spread around house various ways people whose job control sun backyard ladders putting uh filters try make sure sun glare window way would wreck shot like six people three people giving snacks craft table another three people giving healthy snacks separate craft table one person whose job keep getting lost think reason many people one place one time time efficient get done morning going commercial afternoon going commercial mathematics professor princeton get done know wasted time energy fleet people working organism fascinating whole time looking around like neat like one person whose job take camera cameraman someone else whose job remove film canister cause every couple takes replace film know film gets used know geeking whole time fun many takes take looked opposite like two people relaxed right yeah mean person scene professional know improv comedian new york city got given script got said going improv like know improv like know know telling worry knows okay see goes guess got pulled story like heck come guess scene like show random person house know yeah well mean reality stood outside blazing sun someone whose job keep umbrella started sweat started sweat would wreck shot face shiny sweat one person would dab umbrella yeah like reality like strange stalkery person hanging around outside somebody house sure look ways book uh make make like said youtube make videos make awesome parody sort uh parody songs kind focus particular aspect computer science much seem really natural uh much production value goes also team people videos almost videos except ones people would actually seen write lyrics sing song generally find um like backing track online like ca really play instrument cases visuals using like powerpoint powerpoint lots lots powerpoint make sort like animation produced one one people might seen overfitting video charles isbell um produced georgia tech udacity people class together kind usually parody songs kind cap class end class one wearing thriller yeah wearing michael jackson red leather jacket interesting thing podcasting also uh really enjoy team people kind cause know something happens people involved one person way start acting know censorship given especially like slow thinkers like think us trying actually think little bit slow careful kind large teams get way know like like know popular criticize quote unquote mainstream media legitimacy criticizing love listening npr example every clear team behind commerce constant commercial breaks kind like rush like uh okay interrupt go commercial whole creates destroys possibility nuanced conversation yeah exactly evian uh charles uh talked yesterday told evian naive backwards fact mind thinks way uh quite brilliant anyway freedom podcast awkward way palindrome palindrome happen know parts life well know use charles awkward uh challenging parody song make thriller one really fun wrote lyrics really quickly um gave production team recruited cappella group sing one went really smoothly great team focus part really love case writing lyrics uh challenging one challenging bad way challenging really fun way uh one one parody songs halting problem computer science fact ca create program tell arbitrary program whether actually going get stuck infinite loop whether going eventually stop song started new thing learning current songs billy joel piano man great song yeah yeah sing song piano man yeah lyrics great first rhymes uh songs rhyme done rolling stone songs turn rhyme scheme whatsoever sort yelling good time makes fun parody perspective cause like say anything know lines rhymed lot internal rhymes well figuring sing internal rhymes proof halting problem really challenging uh really enjoyed process uh last question topic dancing thriller video many takes take planning dance dance dance studio gave jacket like well ca jacket glove like much um think danced around said dance little bit scene charles dancing together use video recorded um yeah yeah pretty funny charles beautiful wonderful voice really sing really singer designed song spoken section like barry white yeah smooth baritone yeah yeah great awesome one things charles said know everyone knows like super nice guy super passionate teaching um said know true despite fact super cold blood like okay admit finally first time johnny cash song man reno watch die uh actually strong opinions topics fact true uh strong opinions would say ideas think maybe artificial intelligence machine learning maybe life believe true others might know number people might disagree try hard see things multiple perspectives great calvin hobbes calvin hobbes cartoon know okay calvin dad always kind bit foil talked calvin calvin done something wrong dad talks like seeing another perspective calvin like breaks calvin like oh gosh see opposite sides things becomes like cubist cartoon front back everything exposed really freaks finally settles back like oh good make go away like live world tried trying see everything every perspective time things formed opinions would harder think disavow one super intelligence argument existential threat ai one feel pretty confident feeling one like willing hear arguments like particularly moved idea careful accidentally create super intelligence destroy human life let talk let get trouble record video like bill gates think said like quote internet going small thing going really go anywhere think steve ballmer said know sticking microsoft something like smartphones useless reason microsoft get smartphones kind let get let talk agi agi destroying world look back video see think really interesting actually talk nobody really knows future use best intuition difficult predict spoken agi existential risks around sort based intuition quite far away serious concern relative concerns maybe unpack little bit yeah sure sure sure understand example read bostrom book bunch reading material sort general way thinking world think story goes something like point create computers smart enough help design next version smarter previous version eventually bootstrapped smarter us point essentially mercy sort powerful intellect principle control goals goals sync goals like example continued existence humanity wo able stop way powerful us toast know smart people signed story compelling story really get trouble wrote specifically responding quotes elon musk podcast ai summoning demon forget thing said came providence rhode island live said governors states worried entirely wrong thing need worried ai need worried ai journalists kind reacted wanted get people take like okay belief one things makes elon musk successful remarkable individual believes power ideas believes really good idea getting space get space really good idea company change way people drive happen really natural apply idea ai see systems pretty remarkable computational tricks demonstrations take idea push way limit think okay go going take us next deep believer power ideas really natural believe ideas could taken extreme kill us think know strength also undoing mean true like mean happen natural think another way phrase way thinks find difficult argue line thinking sam harris another person science perspective thinks like saying well something fundamental physics universe prevents eventually happening nick bostrom thinks way kind zooming yeah okay humans existing like time scale minutes days intuition time scale minutes hours days look span human history reason reason ca see hundred years like something fundamental laws physics prevent eventually happen destroy way difficult find actually argue sound like rolling ass science fiction think even worse like know kids like got pick kids see pressing short term yeah pressing short term things stop existential crisis much shorter things like especially year covid like kind discussion like like know pressing things today sam harris argument well like day exponential singularity occur difficult argue mean know part story also going put date could thousand years could hundred years could two years long keep making kind progress ultimately become concern kind board thing piece feel like missing way extrapolating moment believe process actually developing technology really get around world really process things world sophisticated way going learn lot means know know right believe turn deep learning network eventually give enough compute eventually get well sure seems really scary wo wo loop wo wo helping design target kinds systems see feels like laws physics systems need help right need need surpass difficulty wall complexity happens arranging something form happen yeah like believe evolution like believe argument right another argument look different perspective people say well believe evolution could evolution sort like random set parts assemble could never happen like okay maybe hard argue clearly get assembled get assembled us basically idea process get point making technology kind awareness process going learn lot process ability control shape build image something going spring existence like gon na contend completely unprepared possible context long arc human history fact spring existence bringing might take like look nuclear weapons like even years springing context human history possible like nuclear weapons could know percentage want put possibility could knocked yeah possibility human beings destroying th century nuclear weapons know really think could really put close like know given like certain moments crisis happened like think one like fear shadows acknowledged much ai run away running away wo enough time think stop right fast takeoff foom yeah mean much bigger concern wonder think wo know happening kind think agi situation already happening social media minds collective intelligence human civilization already controlled algorithm like already super like level collective intelligence thanks wikipedia people donate wikipedia donate wikipedia feed agi man super intelligence line wikipedia values lot better lot things could imagine trust wikipedia trust facebook youtube far trying right thing rational perspective going understand strike sort smarter less smart ways exposing internet yeah interesting thing wikipedia social media different forces right mean wikipedia agi wikipedia like cranky overly competent editor articles know something social media aspect vision agi separate system super intelligent super intelligent one key little thing mean paperclip argument super dumb super powerful systems social media relatively like algorithms may talk today simple algorithms something charles talks lot interactive ai start like scale like tiny little interactions human beings start controlling human beings single algorithm control minds human beings slowly might realize could start wars could start could change way think things feels like long arc history sort zoom outrage tension social media progressing us towards better better things feels like chaos toxic kind stuff chaos toxic yeah feels like actually chaos toxic similar kind debates founding country civil war happened period ultimately tension like something feel right implementation core values hold human beings constantly struggling results people calling shady twitter ultimately algorithm managing feels like possible future algorithm controls us direction whatever looks like yeah right believe power social media screw us royally believe power social media benefit us think yeah sort almost got dropped top us trying culture figure cope sense know arguments say example guess students late students people middle school social media started really take maybe really damaged may really hurt development way way implications quite yet generation hate make somebody else responsibility ones fix ones figure keep good kind technology without letting eat us alive successful move next phase next level game successful yeah going wreck going destroy society going old age sit porch watch world burn tiktok generation believe well kid age right certainly daughter age tapped social stuff also trying find balance right participating getting positives without letting eat alive think sometimes ventures hope watch sometimes think ventures little far consumed times gets little distance enough people like going navigate choppy waters interesting skill actually develop talked dad somehow podcast particular reasons received little bit attention apparently world even though shut love kindness little mini army trolls kind hilarious actually also feel good skill learn look like moderate actually much look discussion dad similar trolls could checking email like anticipating know dad runs large institute drexel university could stressful emails waiting drama kinds temptation check email send email kind pulls feel good skill actually complains learned mean grew without learned skill shut internet walk away think young people also quote unquote damaged like bullied online stories like horrific basically ca escape bullies days growing time also learning skill able shut like disconnect able laugh take seriously fascinating like trying figure like said dropped us trying figure yeah think really interesting guess become believer human design feel like completely understand like make something robust us like flawed many ways yet yet know dominate planet seem manage get scrapes eventually necessarily elegant possible way somehow get get next step know make machine generally speaking like train one reinforcement learning agents play video game works really hard first stage makes succeeds first level new level comes like okay back drawing board somehow humanity keep leveling somehow managing put together skills necessary achieve success semblance success next level know hope keep mentioned reinforcement learning couple years field know quite quite long career artificial intelligence broadly reinforcement learning specifically maybe give hint sense history field ways changed advent deep learning long roots like weaved life seen community change maybe ideas playing change privilege pleasure almost front row seat lot stuff really really fun interesting college eighties early eighties eighties early eighties neural net thing starting happen taking lot psychology classes lot computer science classes college student thought know something play like learn get better ought really easy thing spent almost would vacations college like hacking home computer trying teach play programming language basic oh yeah first language native language first fell love computer science like programming basic computer remember model called model nothing else got computer would bar mitzvahed instead big party parents threw behalf got computer cause really really really wanted saw mall rearshack thought would try stump would give math problems like one plus parentheses two plus one would always get right like know much message go algebra class last years learn stuff seem know smitten got computer think ages memory years think room computer listening billy joel communing possibly listening radio listening billy joel one album vinyl time got cassette tape really helpful cause could play go parents wifi sorry age remember kind walking like okay ready talk people like learned need learn yeah home computer went college like oh totally going study computer science opted college chose specifically computer science major one really wanted college really wanted go college go went yale princeton would way convenient beautiful campus close enough home really excited princeton visited said computer science major like well computer engineering like oh like word engineering like computer science really want like saying hardware software like yeah like want software could care less hardware grew philadelphia grew outside philly yeah yeah local schools like penn drexel temple like every one family went temple least one point lives except yeah philly philly family yale computer science department kind interesting said eighties networks know hot new thing hot thing period college first learned networks yeah yeah learned like psychology class cs class oh wow yeah psychology cognitive science like remember like context yeah yeah yeah always bit cognitive psychology groupie like studied computer science like like hang around cognitive scientists cause know brains man like wacky cool bigger picture view things little less engineering would say interested nature cognition intelligence perception like vision system works asking always bigger questions deep learning community think lot intersections find neuroscience folks actually cognitive psychology cognitive science folks starting learn program use neural artificial neural networks actually approaching problems like totally new interesting ways fun watch grad students departments like approach problem machine learning right come different perspective yeah care like image net data set whatever want like understand like basic mechanisms neuronal level functional level intelligence kind kind cool see work yeah okay always love always groupie cognitive psychology yeah yeah class richard garrick kind favorite psych professor college took like three different classes yeah talking specifically class think kind big paper written steven pinker prince blanking prince first name prince pinker prince wrote kind time kind like blanking names current people cognitive scientists complaining lot deep networks oh gary gary marcus sorry marcus yeah else mean gary gary feisty sure gary feisty know kind kinds say okay well yeah amazing things shortcoming shortcoming shortcoming pinker prince paper kind like generation version marcus davis right trained cognitive scientists looking skeptically results artificial intelligence neural net kind world saying yeah like ca ca ca maybe principle maybe practice point fact matter narrowed focus far impressed know impressed things within circle need broaden circle little bit need look wider set problems seminar college basically close reading pinker prince paper like really thick lot going talked reinforcement learning idea little bit like oh sounds really cool behavior really interesting psychology anyway making programs mean programs things behave people things behave like want make learning learns behave way reinforcement learning presented talking human animal behavior talking actual mathematical constructs ah great good question right think actually talked behavior paper reading think talked learning learning learning behave really neural nets point learning like supervised learning learning produce outputs inputs kind tried invent reinforcement learning graduated joined research group bellcore spun bell labs recently time divestiture long distance local phone service group dave ackley first author boltzmann machine paper first neural net paper could handle xor right xor sort killed neural nets first zero width order first winter yeah perceptron paper hinton along student dave ackley think authors well showed boltzmann machines actually learn nonlinear concepts everything back table kind started second wave neural networks dave ackley became mentor bellcore talked lot learning life computation things fit together dave podcast together get kind enjoy sort perspective even even years later said said really interested learning concept behavior like oh well reinforcement learning gave rich sutton td paper read paper honestly get got idea got using using ideas familiar context neural nets like sort back prop idea making predictions time like interesting really get details said dave dave said oh well come give talk like wait like real people thought words thought like ideas somehow magically seeped paper like know rich like come give talk know mind blown rich came gave talk bell core talked super excited figured time q learning watkins visited rich sutton lab umass andy bartow lab rich part um really excited resolved whole bunch problems know resolve earlier paper uh people know td temporal difference algorithms reinforcement learning right td temporal difference particular making predictions time try use making decisions right cause predict good future action action outcomes future choose one better theory really support changing behavior like predictions consistent process really wanted work one things really cool q learning another algorithm reinforcement learning policy meant could actually learning environment value different actions would actually figuring behave optimally revelation yeah proof kind interesting mean really surprising first read enrich rich sutton book matter kind beautiful single equation capture equation one line code like learn anything yeah like equation code right like code arguably least like squint eyes say intelligence implement single well think started lisp shout lisp uh like single line code key piece code maybe couple could kind magical uh feels good true well sort yeah seems require awful lot extra stuff supporting nonetheless ideas idea really good far know reasonable way trying create adaptive behavior behavior gets better something time find idea optimal uh compelling prove optimal like one part computer science makes people feel warm fuzzy inside prove something like assorting algorithm worst case runs log makes everybody feel good even though reality really matter worst case matters like thing actually work practice particular actual set data enjoy place maybe strong opinion like right course like makes worst case great right worst case analysis great get modularity take thing plug another thing still understanding going happen click together right works well practice words respect distribution care go plug another thing distribution shift change thing may work well anymore want wish hope might ah saying like machine learning yeah positive theoretical results things know come back yeah really weak yeah really weak even say know sorting algorithms like optimal sorting algorithm really one want might true well modularity really powerful statement really like engineer assemble different things count mean interesting balance like everything else life want get obsessed mean computer scientists tend like get obsessed optimize things start optimizing optimize easy like get really granular thing like step n squared n log n sorting algorithm big leap real world systems matter actual behavior system big leap probably said kinds first leaps would take particular problem like picking low hanging fruit whatever equivalent dumbest thing next dumbest thing picking delicious reachable fruit yeah delicious reachable fruit know saying yeah okay eighties kind idea starts percolate yeah got meet got meet rich sutton everything sort downhill really pinnacle everything know felt like kind inside interesting results happening could like check rich jerry tesaro huge impact kind early thinking temporal difference learning reinforcement learning showed could could solve problems know solve way really cool good things happening would hear either people people talking people able track things pretty well nineties excitement reinforcement learning nineties era td gamma like role kind little like fun game playing things breakthroughs know exciting community like cause also built cross part building crossword puzzle solver program solving program called prover interested problem like informing using games understand build intelligent systems like think td gamma like think whole thing nineties yeah mean found td gammon result really remarkable known jerry stuff td gammon system vanilla well entirely vanilla classical kind network playing backgammon training expert moves kind supervised way worked mimic actions learn internally evaluation function learn well expert chose must mean expert values let adjust weights make network evaluates better could learn human preferences could learn preferences took step actually reinforcement learning problem need trainer could let play remarkable think humans often done recent past well people extrapolate like oh well obviously hard obviously could problems want solve know also really hard turned ended practical partly think neural nets certainly time struggling consistent reliable training reinforcement learning setting bit mess know generation generation master students wanted value function approximation basically reinforcement learning neural nets failing could get good results jerry tosaro got believe jerry neural net whisperer particular ability get neural networks things people would find impossible technology technology jerry together yeah think speaks role human expert process machine learning right easy drawn idea technology power coming think lose sight fact sometimes need really good like mean one would think hey great piece software like know gnu emacs whatever prove computers super powerful basically going take world like stahman hell hacker right able make code amazing things could done without computer computer could done without think people discount role people like jerry particular set skills topic way small side note tweeted emacs greater vim yesterday deleted tweet minutes later realized fire started war yeah like oh kidding provocative going walk back forth people still feel passionately particular piece yeah get emacs clearly much better understand say spent block time making fingers know emacs keys part thought process need express take emacs key bindings away become ca express way know know kinesis keyboard keyboard yes seen know sexy elegant beautiful yeah gorgeous way expensive problem similar emacs learn use harder use things hard use things absurd thing small elegant lightweight beautiful little laptops sitting coffee shop giant kinesis keyboard sexy little laptop absurd used feel bad time kind sometimes back billy joel thing throw billy joel record throw back kinesis keyboard throw billy joel record throw taylor swift justin bieber wind see like musical taste heard justin bieber enough like really like songs taylor swift like songs daughter convinced genius basically signed onto true yeah speaks back robustness human brain speaks power plasticity like mouse teach probably dog teach enjoy taylor swift try know tried know acclimation right like said couple weeks interesting experiment actually try listen intent experiment like social media intended experiment see take society turned way think person side week listening taylor swift let try know compartmentalized worried like get worried worried compartmentalize really well wo bleed parts life wo start know wearing red lipstick whatever fine fine change fashion everything fine know thing watch walk coffee shop recognize song wo know singing along everybody coffee shop looking like yeah know people afraid agi afraid taylor swift takeover yeah mean people know td gammon get would call like terminology chance like systems learn playing know best word problem term know silly like big bang like like talking serious physicists like term big bang early feel like early days know maybe used previously think used small group people like think still deciding ridiculously silly name good name cons potentially one important concepts artificial intelligence okay depends broadly apply term used term phd dissertation wow actual terms yeah tassaro paper something like training expert backgammon player think title paper title definitely term used another term got work roll know ever hear term roll backgammon term applied generally computers well least ai td gammon yeah fascinating used like feel like general powerful content sort idea well machine going teach smart yeah maybe correct know continuation spirit actually like literally exact algorithms td gammon applied deepmind openai learn games little bit complex learning artificial intelligence go presented artificial intelligence modern approach know explicitly pointed go books like unsolvable kind thing like implying approaches hit limit particular kind games something remember book said something head professors instilled idea like limits artificial intelligence field like instilled idea create system solve game go achieved agi kind explicitly like say feeling one people seemed magical learning system able beat human world champion game go even alphago even alphago zero kind renamed advanced alphazero beating world champion player without supervised learning expert games playing know make think would interesting hear opinions exciting surprising profound interesting boring breakthrough performance alphazero okay alphago knocked socks remarkable aspect got work actually able leverage whole bunch different ideas integrate one giant system software engineering aspect never part program complicated program built like jerry tesaro neural net whisperer david silver kind neural net whisperer able coax networks new way architectures solve problems said learning ai one idea make work remarkable techniques good playing chess could beat world champion chess could beat typical go playing teenager go fact short number years kind ramped trouncing people go blew away kind focusing engineering aspect also surprising mean something different large companies mean compute aspect course similar deep blue ibm something important learned remembered large company taking ideas already investing million dollars kind saying engineering kind fascinating without go probably gathering data right expert games like organizing everything actually distributed supervised learning see engineering kind took granted philosophically able persist way able persist face long odds feels like would one skeptical people room thinking learn way beat go sounded like especially david silver sounded like david confident funny confidence works like cocky right cocky kind stop stall get anywhere yeah hope unbreakable maybe better confidence kind wishful hope little dream almost want anything else kind keep seems story enough skepticism looking problems fighting know got way thing yeah probably bunch little factors come play funny stories come together everything life came play love video games also connection happen td gammon yeah ways surprising maybe provide intuition much td gammon done quite long time reinforcement learning front yeah weird mean like said students worked tried get basically apply architecture problems consistently failed couple really nice demonstrations ended literature paper controlling elevators right like okay modify heuristic elevators use deciding like bank elevators deciding floors stopping maximize throughput essentially set reinforcement learning problem neural net represent value function taking elevators button pushes high dimensional well time high dimensional input couple dozen dimensions turn prediction oh going better stop floor ultimately appeared though standard simulation distribution people trying leave building end day neural net learned better strategy standard one implemented elevator controllers nice work satindra singh et al handoffs cell phones deciding hand cell tower cell tower oh okay communication networks yeah yeah couple things seemed like really promising none made production aware neural nets whole started kind implode around lot air room people try figure okay get work rl setting found way back plus years said alphago impressive like big spectacle right alphazero think may slightly different opinion people talked satindra singh particular satindra like rich sutton student antibarto came lab influential machine learning reinforcement learning researcher deepmind rich though different sites two alberta rich alberta satindra would england think england michigan moment yes much impressed alphago zero get kind bootstrap beginning games purely though first one alphago also tremendous amount started action network making decisions trained really long time using traditional temporal difference methods result seem different seems like yeah would work works works found removal extra information breathtaking game changer first thing game changer open question guess assumption expert games might contain within humongous amount information know went beyond know somehow got away game somehow got away information learning strategies think alphago better implementing human strategies think actually developed strategies effective perspective okay well made least one quantum leap terms strategic knowledge okay maybe makes three okay first one doozy right getting work reliably networks hold onto value well enough big step well maybe could speak reinforcement learning front starting scratch learning something like first random behavior crappy behavior somewhat okay behavior obvious impossible take steps think intuition heck random behavior become somewhat basic intelligent behavior human level superhuman level basic saying intuition like go human superhuman level intelligence particular task game playing good taking leaps take many system believe system take kind leap yeah also think beginner knowledge go start get feel really quickly idea certain parts board seems associated winning right stumbling upon concept winning told wins loses well self play wins loses told side information kind start percolating around make difference well things better chance helping win things worse chance helping win get basic play think pretty quickly basic play well kind forced search actually experiment okay well gets next increment improvement far think okay kind bring elon musk sam harris right far intuition kinds mechanisms able take us feels one ominous stated calmly things talked david silver said yet discovered ceiling alphazero example game go chess like keeps matter much compute throw keeps improving possible possible throw like x compute improve x something like stated calmly like oh yeah guess like think like well potentially like continuations moore law totally different ways like broadly defined moore law continental improvement exponential improvement like going alphazero swallows world notice getting better things getting better notice getting better things getting better go think big leap say okay well therefore better things well mean question much game life turned right think really good question think think know community really know answer okay went went talk experts computer chess particular computer chess really interesting know course thousand years humans best chess playing things planet computers like edged ahead best person ahead ever since like people overtaken computers computers people together overtaken computers right least last time checked know latest last time checked teams people could work computer programs defeat best computer programs game go game chess game chess right using information things called elo scores sort notion strong player kind range possible scores increment score basically beat another player lower score time something like like threshold somewhat consistently beat someone higher score person question many times chess right know range human ability levels cap best playing humans computers went step beyond computers people together gone think full step beyond feels estimates starting asymptote reached kind maximum best possible chess playing means kind finite strategic depth right point ca get better game yeah mean like check think interesting somebody like magnus carlsen using chess programs train mind like learn chess become better chess player yeah like interesting thing static creatures learning together mean like talking social networks algorithms teaching us like teaching algorithms fascinating thing think best chess playing programs better pairs like competition pairs still even interesting question ceiling david ominous david silver kind statement like found ceiling right question okay know analysis talking go experts depth strategic depth go seems substantially greater chess kind steps improvement make getting better better better better reason think infinite could david seeing kind asymptoting keep getting better diminishing returns point hit optimal play like theory finite games finite optimal strategy strategy mini max optimal strategy point ca get better ca beat strategy strategy may information processing perspective intractable right need situations sufficiently different ca compress giant mess hard coded rules never achieve still puts cap many levels improvement actually make thing self play put although like broader category self supervised learning require much human human labeling yeah human label human effort human involvement past certain point thing could argue true recent breakthroughs natural english processing language models oh get gpt three yeah see uh good good transition yeah yeah practiced days leading know uh like one questions find ways formulate problems world important us humans like important game chess uh self supervised kinds approaches could applied whether self play example like maybe could think like autonomous vehicles simulation kind stuff robotics applications simulation uh self supervised learning uh unannotated data data generated humans naturally without extra costs like wikipedia like internet used learn something create intelligence systems something uh really powerful pass touring test kind superhuman level performance intuition trying stitch together discussion agi limits self play thoughts maybe limits neural networks context language models intuition might useful think yeah yeah yeah first whole transformer network family things um really cool really really cool mean know ever back day played know markov models generating texts seen kind texts spit compare happening amazing amazing take long interacting one systems find holes right amazing smart kind general way really good bunch things seem understand lot statistics language extremely well turns powerful answer many questions make good conversationalist right make good storyteller makes good imitating things seen past exact thing could said people voting donald trump joe biden supporters people voting joe biden donald trump supporters know intelligent following yeah following things seen past take long find flaws like natural language generation abilities yes interesting critical ai systems right similar thought stories spits amazing mean computers smarter realize necessarily partly means people dumber realize much day day deep like kind going flow saying whatever feels like natural thing say next lot creative meaningful intentional enough actually get get right come new ideas sometimes manage talk things sometimes sometimes vote reasonable people sometimes really hard see statistics much saying kind rote metrics use measure systems reveal interstices hard detect intuition language models grow size already surprising go noticeable improvement question goes back ominous david silver ceiling right maybe ceiling need compute mean okay speculating yes opposed completely firm ground right believe get something really language use language thing interact people like think enough take everything said written say enough learn intelligent think really need pushed back think conversations even people pretty smart maybe smartest thing know maybe smartest thing imagine get much benefit talking interacting presumably conversations live guests something interaction would exposed oh write story read later think think systems learning stories learning pushed back us fundamentally limited could actually become route get shut like argument argument us lose couple times start realize oh okay wait nuance actually matters yeah actually subtle sounding quite profound interaction humans essential limitation within profound well time scale like bandwidth really interact humans low costly ca one underlying things self plays know large number interactions ca really deploy reinforcement learning systems real world interact like could deploy language model real world interact humans getting enough data relative cost takes interact like time humans expensive really interesting good takes us back reinforcement learning trying figure ways make algorithms efficient learning keep spirit reinforcement learning become efficient sense seems goal love hear thoughts know got chance see blog post called bitter lesson oh yes rich sutton makes argument hopefully summarize perhaps perhaps yeah okay mean could try correct makes argument seems look long arc history artificial intelligence field calls know years algorithms seen biggest improvements practice simple like dumb algorithms able leverage computation wait computation improve like academics fun finding little tricks congratulate tricks sometimes tricks like big feel moment like big spikes breakthroughs reality decades still dumb algorithm waits compute get faster faster mm find interesting argument entirety field machine learning academic discipline really subfield computer architecture yeah kind waiting around next thing really want hardware work right really want think procrastinating yes right waiting job pretend done yeah mean argument reminds lot think fred jelinek quote early computational linguist said know building computational linguistic systems every time fire linguist performance goes something like idea us building knowledge case much less finding much less successful get rid people know language know kind scholastic academic kind perspective replace compute think kind modern version story okay want better machine vision could build know motivated models know feel like obviously right thing throw lot data guess better lot data thought moment way believe well thought believe believe know compositionality right way say complexity grows rapidly consider possibilities like explosively far moore law also growing explosively exponentially really seem like well think really hard algorithm design way build systems best benefit could get exponential best benefit get waiting exponential wait got got end right hints moore law starting feel friction starting world pushing back little bit one thing know lots people know know trying write essay yeah moore law amazing enabled sorts things also kind counter moore law development cost successive generation chips also doubling costing twice much money amount development money per cycle whatever actually sort constant point run money come entirely different way development process like guess always always bit skeptical look exponential curve therefore end soon number people going neurips greater population earth means going discover life planets means sigmoid curve front half looks lot like exponential second half going look lot like diminishing returns yeah mean interesting thing moore law actually like look technologies involved hundreds thousands curves stacked top actually exponential curve constant breakthroughs becomes useful think exactly saying cost development like size teams amount resources invested continuing find new curves new breakthroughs yeah interesting idea know live moment sit today seems reasonable thing say exponentials end yet software realm keep appearing happening mean hard disagree elon musk like know used one folks still one folks studied autonomous vehicles worked like look elon musk saying autonomous vehicles well obviously couple years year next month fully autonomous vehicles like reason ca driving pretty simple like learning problem need convert driving data know trains data like use eyes use cameras train like yeah work put hat like philosophical hat put pragmatic hat like flaws computer vision like means trans scale put human factors psychology hat like actually driving us lot cognitive science cognitive whatever heck call really hard much harder drive realize much larger number edge cases building intuition around around exponential really difficult top pandemic making us think exponentials making us realize like understand anything able intuit exponentials either ultra terrified part population part like uh opposite whatever different carefree managing blase wow french uh got accent uh fascinating think limits exponential growth technology moore law technology rubs bitter lesson gpt three self play mechanisms like obvious used much skeptical neural networks least give slither possibility much surprised also know uh caught way like uh prepared like applications um social networks example feels like really good transformer models able kind like good uh natural language generation kind models could used learn human behavior manipulate human behavior gain advertisers dollars kinds things uh capitalist system arguably already manipulating human behavior yeah yeah self preservation think big would big step like trying manipulate us convince us shut would freaked see path abilities trying trying keep people site see thing thing life earth might borrowing consciousness sentience like like sense creators algorithms like know look body single organism huge number organism like tiny little motivations built top sense ai algorithms like system includes companies corporations right cause corporations funny organisms really seem self preservation built think design level think design self preservation focus right broader system also part influence much complicated much powerful yeah agree people really love ask three books technical philosophical fiction big impact life maybe recommend went movies went billy joel forgot music recommended said taste music like pop music actually really skillful way thank thanks going try books skillful way avoid answering question three books would recommend like tell story first job college bellcore mentioned worked dave ackley head group guy named tom landauer know well known known arguably inventor first proselytizer word embeddings developed system shortly got group yeah called latent semantic analysis would take words english embed multi hundred dimensional space use way know assessing similarity basically reinforcement learning sorry reinforcement information retrieval know sort information retrieval trained anthropologist would became cognitive scientist cognitive science research group know like said cognitive science groupie time thought become cognitive scientist realized group computer scientist computer scientist really loves hang cognitive scientists said studied language acquisition particular said know humans number words vocabulary learned reading said ca true really big vocabulary read like must like think mean like stop signs definitely read stop signs like reading books thing really though might visual maybe red color read stop signs yeah pattern recognition point sound yeah wonder oh yeah stop guns fascinating read mean obviously read read read plenty books like people like charles friend charles others like lot people field lot academics like reading really central topic development guy fact used joke got college kind help illiterate kind program got college like house particularly bad good reader got college surrounded people voracious reading appetite would like read read read like clearly qualified school like way discovered books tape like audio books much better caught read lot books small tangent fascinating open question topic driving whether know supervised learning people machine learning people think like drive learn drive possible us humans first walking also watching people drive even inside cars passenger let say inside car passenger even like pedestrian crossing road learn much driving possible without ever inside car okay driving get like watching movie example know something like taught anyone drive except two children learned lot car driving wife want one car learning job sit passenger seat really scary wishes live figuring things start much better imagine like neural network would get seeing world get road trying get relationship angle steering takes jerky happens pretty quickly like ability stay lane speed happens relatively fast learning pretty fast thing remarkably hard think partly cars really hard degree driving social interaction activity blew away completely unaware watched son learning drive realizing sending signals cars around case always social communication challenges sending mixed confusing signals cars causing cars drive weirdly erratically question mind would accident know read things speed drive positioning car constantly like head driver head drivers seeing knowing taught explicitly okay thinking driver thinking revelation stunned yeah quite brilliant creating theories mind theories mind cars yeah yeah heard discussed car talks since people consider kinds issues way subtle little bit work involved realize especially focus cars pedestrians example literally staring face yeah yeah yeah like interact pedestrians pedestrians practically talking octopus point got weird degrees freedom know going turn around second point humans know going good theory mind good mental model good model model view model model model able reason kind social game hope quite simple actually could learned talked waymo know know company google south africa talked cto podcast rode car quite aggressive quite fast good feels great also like tesla waymo made change mind maybe driving easier thought maybe speciesist human centered maybe speciesist argument yes know fascinating think reading think said avoided question though still hope answered somewhat avoided brilliantly blind spots artificial intelligence researchers actually takes learn solve problem fascinating anka dragan yeah one favorites much energy amazing fantastic particular thinks lot kind know know know kind planning last time spoke articulate ways cars solved still really really hard even intuition limited new sense elon musk approach ultra confident like plowing put putting people say reckless dangerous partly seems one ways make progress artificial intelligence difficult things democracy messy implementation artificial intelligence systems real world messy many years ago cars actual thing could discussion somebody asked could use robotic technology use drive cars around people going killed blah blah blah like going happen said confidence incorrectly obviously think going happen going lot gradual kind rollout people cars closed communities right somewhat realistic still box right really get sense weird things happen change way behave around vehicles obviously requires kind coevolution ca plop see happens course basically popping see happens wrong think would better plan yeah intuition funny zooming looking forces capitalism seems capitalism rewards risk takers rewards punishes risk takers try academic approach let try small thing try understand slowly fundamentals problem let start one two see three capitalist startup entrepreneurial dream let build thousand right fail whatever learned good enough one thing intuition would say going hugely destructive everything actually forces capitalism easy critical actually look data way world progressed terms quality life seems competent good people rise top coming soviet union interesting somebody like elon musk way push progress artificial intelligence forcing waymo step stuff waymo forcing elon musk step fascinating tension heart upset lack progress autonomous vehicles within academia huge progress early days darpa challenges kind stopped like mit true everywhere else exception sponsors like seen sexy problem like moment artificial intelligence starts approaching problems real world like academics kind like right get really hard different way different way right think yeah right us excited way still think fundamentals problems solved difficult things still publishable think need criticism could conferences europe cvpr application papers often powerful important like theory paper even like theory seems much respectable mean machine learning communities changing little bit mean least statements still seen sexiest pursuits like actually make thing work practice opposed toy data set say still avoiding three books question something audiobook recommend oh yeah mean yeah read lot really fun stuff terms books find thinking back read ago like test time degree find thinking program programmed lot douglas roshkop basically put premise need become programmers one form another analogy upon time become readers become literate time everybody literate literacy possible people literate say society people made big effort get everybody speed universal quite widespread assumption generally people read analogy makes programming similar kind thing need say right reader literate reader means receive information get put programming way get put argument made think specifically backed away idea think happening quite way might true society sort play forward quite way still believe premise still believe point relationship machines networks one individual wherewithal make machines help things person wants done software people know problem like okay hack pearlscript something make lived world everybody could would better world computers would think less sway us people software would less sway us group yeah sense software engineering programming power programming power right yeah like magic like magic spells reach everyone moment sliver population commune machines way know book big big impact currently reading alignment problem actually brian christian know seen yet similar russell work control problem general neighborhood mean take different emphases concentrating think think stuart book remarkably good job like like celebratory good job describing ai technology sort works thought great really cool see book yeah think experience writing books know probably possible thing maybe thought thing two explain ai people yeah yeah really good point book far remarkably good telling story sort history recent history things happened first third said book three thirds first third essentially ai fairness implications ai society seeing right great mean telling stories really well went talked frontline people whose names associated ideas terrific says second half book reinforcement learning maybe fun third half third third super intelligence alignment problem suspect part less fun read yeah yeah interesting problem talk find interesting like thinking whether live simulation thought experiment think existence way talking alignment problem agi good way think similar like trolley problem autonomous vehicles useless thing engineering nice little thought experiment actually thinking like human ethical systems moral systems thinking engineered things start understand good one book recommend exhalations ted chiang bunch short stories ted chiang guy wrote short story became movie arrival stories computer scientist actually studied brown sort really insightful bit science computer science drives romp right like creates artificial worlds extrapolating ideas know really thought kind conclusion stuff really fun read sure familiar seem mention every word soviet union russian read way much dostoyevsky roots russian couple generations back well probably somewhere maybe pull thread little bit existential dread feel mentioned think somewhere conversation mentioned really pretty much like dying forget context might reinforcement learning perspective know know know teaching kids drive face mortality yes human perspective reinforcement learning researcher perspective let ask absurd question think meaning whole thing meaning life spinning rock mean think reinforcement learning researchers maybe think science perspective often lot people right supervised learning person probably thinking sweep lifetime reinforcement learning agents little lifetimes little weird little lifetimes hard project world sometimes know far meaning life turned may know book read hitchhiker guide galaxy meaning life turned meaning life party invited people everyone shared meaning life slides made sat slide presentation meaning life mine mine balance think life balance activity party year old maybe little bit found little toys devices balance like stand balance pogo stick brought rip stick like weird skateboard got unicycle know love watching try yeah send video great managed balanced

versus engineering dichotomy building good software hardware systems well good design guess pretty obvious engineering mean reduction practice known methods science pursuit discovering things people understand solving unknown problems definitions interesting thinking theory constructing models kind generalize things work engineering actually building stuff pragmatic like okay nice models actually get things work maybe economics nice example like economists models economy works different policies effect actual okay let call engineering like actually deploying policies computer design almost engineering reduction practice known methods complexity computers built know could think well go write code verify put together find combination stuff complicated inventive figure right definitely happens lot every often big idea happens might one person idea space engineering space ideas well give example one limits computer performance branch prediction whole bunch ideas good could predict branch people said limit asymptotic curve somebody came better way branch prediction lot better published paper every computer world uses one idea engineers build branch prediction hardware happy drop one kind training array put another one real idea branch prediction one key problems underlying sort lowest level software boils branch prediction boils uncertainty computers limited single thread computers limited two things predictability path branches predictability locality data predictors predict pretty well memories couple hundred cycles away local cache couple cycles away executing fast virtually data local cache simple program says add one every element array really easy see stream data might complicated program get element array look something make decision go get another element kind random think really unpredictable make big predictor looks kind pattern realize well get data data probably want one get one one one probably want one theory engineering like paper written asymptotic kind discussion like hack works well little bit like information theory think somewhere okay actually trying prove kind stuff know method implementing engineering problem flip side big design team percentage people think plan life work engineering versus inventing things lots companies reward filing patents many big companies get stuck get promoted come something new happens everybody trying random new thing matter basics get neglected dichotomy think like cell library basic cad tools basic software validation methods simple stuff wan na work exciting stuff spend lots time trying figure patent something mostly useless breakthroughs simple stuff simple stuff really well building building bricks want great bricks go two places sell bricks one guy says yeah ugly pile guy like lovingly tells kinds bricks hard beautiful square one gon na buy bricks gon na make better house talking craftsman person understands bricks loves bricks loves varieties good word good engineering great craftsmanship start thinking engineering invention set system rewards invention craftsmanship gets neglected okay maybe one perspective theory science overemphasizes invention engineering emphasizes craftsmanship therefore matter theory engineering well everybody like read tech racks always talking breakthrough innovation everybody thinks important thing number innovative ideas actually relatively low need right innovation creates whole new opportunity like guy invented internet right like big thing million people wrote software mostly engineering software writing elaboration idea huge know know ben danai wrote javascript days interesting story makes wonder famously many years considered pretty crappy programming language still perhaps improving sort consistently interesting thing guy know get awards get nobel prize fields medal crappy piece software code well currently number one programming language world runs increasingly running back end internet well know everybody uses like would interesting thing right thing right time like stuff like javascript came like move writing c programs call managed code frameworks write simple code might interpreted lots libraries productivity high expert know java supposed solve world problems complicated javascript came know bunch scripting languages expert yeah right thing right time right thing right time something know clever one elements maybe figured get prize like constructed theory yeah know maybe problem defined needs good promoter well think bunch blog posts written like wrong right like crappy thing fast like hacking together thing answers needs iterating time listening developers like listening people actually use thing something software right time like sense good instinct right time right tool make super simple get problem true hardware less true software backward compatibility drags behind try fix mistakes past timing good something accidental give broad sense needed scientifically community like obvious interesting thing javascript everything ran browser time like java think like scheme programming languages separate external container javascript literally injected webpage dumbest possible thing running thread everything else inserted comment javascript code inserted comment html code either genius super dumb like right apparatus like virtual machine container executed framework program already running yeah cool something accessibility ease use resulted developers innovating actually use mean even know make seem echo across different software like stories different software php story really crappy language took world always joke random length instructions variable length instructions always even though obviously worse like nobody knows x arguably worst architecture planet one popular ones well mean also story risk simplicity something simplicity us evolutionary process valued simple spreads faster seems like always true always true yeah could simple good simple bad risk win think far risk win long archipelago tree know gon na win risk sysc gon na win space instruction sets ai software gon na win little computers run little programs like normal place going another transformation think instruction sets underneath change yeah evolve slowly matter much matter much okay mean limits performance predictability instructions data mean big thing usability quality design quality tools availability like right x proprietary intel amd change way want independently arm proprietary arm wo let anybody else change like sole point open source anybody change super cool also might mean gets changed many random ways common subset people use like open like closed like bet money one versus idea case dependent well x oddly enough intel first started developing licensed like seven people open architecture move faster others also bought one two seven different people making x time zs could argue everybody thought z better instruction set proprietary one place oh like four five different microprocessors intel went open got market share people felt like multiple sources time narrowed two players historian intel win long processors great process development great looking back javascript brennan like microsoft netscape internet browsers microsoft browser game aggressively stole people ideas like right know know intel stealing people ideas started good way stealing good way clarify started making rams random access memories time japanese manufacturers came know getting competed pivoted microprocessors made first know integrated microprocessor rent programs something behind pivot hell pivot andy grove great hell pivot led semiconductor industry like little company ibm kinds big companies boatloads money everybody okay yeah yeah like marketing stuff processor designs pretty good think know core probably first one thought great really fast processor haswell great makes great processor oh look performance versus everybody else know size usability specific kind element makes beautiful like literally raw performance think bioprocessors like raw performance course like horse race fastest one wins care long wins well fastest environment like know years made fastest one could people started power limits made fastest right powerpoint started like could scale processors guy could faster like single thread threads lots variability arm really explored like know series r series series like family processors different design points like unbelievably small simple design sort like big palette cpus like ones credible know top bottom palette mean credible top bottom well people make microcontrollers small fast one people make fast processors medium one small one hard full palette seems like yeah lot difference arm folks intel terms way approaching problem well intel almost processor designs know custom know last years fastest horse possible yeah one horse race yeah architecture really good company fairly insular going industry cad tools stuff debate custom design versus synthesis approach say intel slow getting synthesize processors arm came bottom generated ip went kinds customers little say customer implemented ip arm super friendly synthesis ip environment whereas intel said gon na make great client chip server chip cad tools process know supporting ip everything works stuff arm winning mobile platform space terms process describing winning well lots people lots different experiments controlled processor architecture ip let people put lots different chips lot variability happened whereas intel made mobile foray mobile one team one part right experiments mindset pc mindset microsoft software mindset brought whole bunch things along mobile world embedded world think possible intel pivot hard win mobile market hell difficult thing right huge company pivot mean interesting talk current work like clear pcs dominating several decades like desktop computers mobile unclear leadership question like apple steve jobs came back pivoted multiple times know built ipads itunes phones tablets great macs like knew computers made aluminum nobody knew great super fun steve yeah steve jobs like pivoted multiple times old intel multiple times made drams processors processes got ask like working steve jobs work interact twice said hi twice cafeteria say hi said hey fellas friendly wandering around somebody could find table cafeteria packed gave table worked mike colbert talked like mike unofficial cto apple brilliant guy worked steve years maybe talked steve multiple times day one people could put steve let say brilliance intensity steve really liked steve trusted mike translate shit thought engineering products work mike ran group called platform architecture group many times sitting mike phone would ring maybe steve mike would hold phone like steve would yelling something yeah would translate translated would say steve wants us steve good engineer know great idea guy idea person really good selector talent yeah seems one key elements leadership right really good first principles guy like somebody say something could done would think obviously wrong right know maybe hard maybe expensive maybe need different people know like whole bunch know want something hard know maybe takes time maybe iterate whole bunch things could think saying ca done stupid would compare seems like elon musk engineering centric also think considered designer design mind steve jobs feels like much idea space design space versus engineering make happen like world way figure used computers know computer people talk time like mike really good computer guy knew computers could computer meaning computer hardware like low level stuff software pieces whole thing would know idea could next grounded reality like know finger painting wall wishing somebody would interpret interesting connection computer architect designer intuition computers could happen interesting say intuition seems like pissing lot engineers intuition ca done like stories like floppy disks kind stuff like yeah steve first round like go lab look going hate fire people ask somebody elevator apple know happy came back impression surrounded relatively small group people really interact outside much joke see like somebody moving prototype quad black blanket cause secret know partly steve cause want steve see ready yeah dynamic johnny ive steve interesting like want ruins many ideas generates yeah yeah dangerous kind line walk lot ideas like like gordon bell famous ideas right percentage good ideas way higher anybody else many ideas also good talking people getting filters right know see stuff whereas elon like hey want build rockets steve hired two rocket guys elon would go read rocket manuals elon better engineer sense like like like love passion manuals details details craftsmanship right well guess craftsmanship different kind make standard little longer make like anger passion firing mood swings madness know emotional steve guess elon bugger feature feature graph axis productivity yeah x axis zero chaos infinity complete order yeah right go know origin improve order improve productivity yeah point productivity peaks goes back much order nothing happen yes question close chaos thing start moving direction order force vector drive towards order unstoppable oh slip tongue every organization move place productivity stymied order need question counterforce like cause also feels really good get organized productivity goes organization feels orient towards right hired people got guys run process get bigger right inevitably organization gets captured bureaucracy manages processes yeah right humans really like walk room say guys love need less order force behind nothing happen ca tell many levels profound say feature could nicer know know good examples nicer well funny thing get stuff done need people manage stuff manage people humans complicated need lots care feeding need tell look nice good stuff pat back right know tell needed oh yeah humans need friend started managing group said figured praise anything waiting done always mad tell great job get stuck trap something confront people think lot people trauma childhood would disagree successful people need first rough stuff nice later know okay know engineering companies full adults kinds range childhoods know people okay childhoods well know know lots people work praise weird mean like everybody interested well probably looking somebody approval even still yeah maybe think maybe somebody longer us kind thing know used call dad tell excited engineering stuff got approval yeah lot lucky like decided smart unusual kid okay really young poorly school dyslexic read third fourth grade care parents like oh fine lucky cool still us miss sure yeah parkinson cancer last years tough killed killing man like hard mind well pretty good parkinson causes slow dementia chemotherapy think accelerated like hallucinogenic dementia clever funny interesting pretty unusual remember conversations course course time like fond memories guy yeah oh yeah anything come mind friend told one time could draw computer whiteboard faster anybody ever met said meet dad like kid come home say driving bridge thinking pulled piece paper draw whole bridge mechanical engineer yeah would draw whole thing would tell tell would changed idea could understand conceive anything grew natural interview people ask draw picture something whiteboard really interesting like people draw little box say talks like oh frustrating guy come one time says well designed floating point chip really like tell whole thing works tell floating point works inside mind covered two whiteboards like minutes hired like great craftsman mean craftsmanship yeah also mental agility understand whole thing put pieces context real view balance design worked understand properly start draw fill half whiteboard like little piece like ability lay understandable way takes lot understanding able zoom detail zoom big picture zoom really fast impossible thing see dad believe anything weird feature craftsman yeah seems echoes behavior like well anybody anything right right work get better might limit funny things like always wanted play piano end life started playing piano parkinson terrible thought really worked life maybe next life better might onto something yeah enjoyed yeah pretty funny think perfect enemy good hardware software engineering like talking javascript little bit messiness day building process yeah creative tension right creative tension two different ideas ca right fact want causes go try solve problem creative part building computers like people say schedule anything fit schedule ca right throw perfect schedule hate people say need get perfectly right matter people money right really clear idea want people really good articulating let call perfect yeah yeah right also terrible never ship anything never hit goals framework yes ca throw stuff ca get done today maybe got done tomorrow next project right ca work guy really like working overfilters ideas overfilters start thinking something soon figured wrong throw start thinking come idea find wrong give little time set sometimes figure tweak maybe idea helps idea idea generation really funny give idea space like spaciousness mind key also execute programs get shit done turns computer engineering fun takes people build computer whatever number people variable temperament skill sets stuff big organization find people love perfect ideas people want get stuff done yesterday people like come ideas people like let say shoot ideas takes whole takes large group people good generating ideas good filtering ideas giant mess somehow guess goal giant mess people find perfect path creative tension know said people good articulating perfect looks like good design like sitting room set ideas like design better processor know something special good idea let try ever brainstormed idea couple people really smart kind go quite understand working start talking putting whiteboard maybe takes days weeks brain starts kind synchronize really weird like start see thinking starts work like see work like talent computer design see computers work head like really well know people working people like kind amazing experience every get place find flaw kind funny fool two kind drifted along direction useless yeah happens like know nice thing computer design always reduction practice like come good ideas know architects really love ideas work put shelf go work next idea put shelf never reduce practice find good bad cause almost every time done something really new time done like good parts good know flaws yeah would say career experience career defined mostly flaws successes like great tension tried hard right done something new right gon na facing challenges build find problems look back see problems okay look back remember think earlier career like ev second alpha chip embarrassed mistakes could barely talk guinness book world records fastest processor planet point realized really bad mental framework deal like something new bunch new things worked great bad learned lot next one learned lot ev also really cool things think proportion good stuff went couple fatal flaws painful yeah learned channel pain like pride pride really realization world works kind idea set works life suffering reality know buddha said couple people stuck kind weird combination good bad light darkness tolerate deal yeah definitely lots suffering world depends perspective seems like way darkness makes light part really nice computing hardware kind even software design find beautiful work people work talking battleground flaws mistakes errors things beautifully done something pops mind well things beautifully done usually set abstraction layers whole thing works unison nicely yes say abstraction layer means two different components work together work independently know one decoupling yeah famous one network stack network stack data transport protocol layers innovation really got right networks define well layers could innovate independently occasionally layer boundary interface would upgraded let design space breathe could something new layer seven without worry layer four worked good design see processor designs zen design amd made several components modular insistence top wanted interfaces defined wrote rtl pieces one verification leads said right test pieces well independently put together wo find interaction bugs floating point knows cache works little skeptical mostly right modularity design greatly improved quality universally true general would say good designs modularity usually modular well talked humans smart getting smarter right complexity things going beautiful design ca bigger person piece like odds really beautiful design something way hard low right way simple interesting like well anybody could get right match expertise mental power right design size cool big enough make meaningful impact world framework design pieces whole thing big harmonious put together sufficiently interesting used beautiful design matching limits human cognitive capacity module create creating nice interface modules thereby think limit kind beautiful complex systems build kind modular design like build increasingly complicated think like internet okay let scale think like social network like twitter one computing system little modules right built many components nobody twitter even understands alien showed looked twitter would see twitter beautiful simple thing everybody uses really big would see networks runs fiber optics data transported computers whole thing bloody complicated nobody twitter understands think alien would see yeah alien showed looked twitter looked various different network systems see earth imagine really smart could comprehend whole thing sort evaluated human thought really interesting human planet comprehends system built individual well would even see individual humans interesting like humans think us central organism networks connection organisms perspective alien outside perspective seems yeah get ants see ant colony ant colony yeah result production ant colony like cities sense humans pretty impressive modularity able robust noise mutation kind stuff well time yeah build cities buildings get earthquakes occasionally wars know wars earthquakes viruses every changes business plans shipping something like long keeps adapting situation curious phenomenon well let talk moore law little bit broad view moore law exponential improvement computing capability like openai example recently published kind paper looking exponential improvement training efficiency neural networks like imagenet kind stuff got better purely software side figuring better tricks algorithms training neural networks seems improving significantly faster moore law prediction software space think moore law continues general version moore law continues think comes mostly hardware software mix two interesting totally reduction size transistor kind thing totally interesting kinds innovations hardware space kind stuff well like half dozen things going graph one initial innovations lot headroom exploited efficiency networks improved dramatically decomposability started running one computer multiple computers multiple gpus arrays gpus thousands point sort like going like single computer application thousand computer application really moore law thing independent vector many computers put problem computers getting better like moore law rate ability go one thousand something multiplied amount computers took resolve like alexnet resnet transformers quite steady improvements like exactly kind underlying moore law beginning biggest productive rich source future think hardware software hardware gon na move along relatively slowly like know double performance every two years like call slowly yeah slow version snail pace moore law maybe trademark one whereas scaling number computers know go much faster sure point google initial search engine running laptop point really worked scaling factored indexer piece piece piece spread data things dozen innovations scaled number computers kept breaking finding new bottlenecks software schedulers made rethink like seems insane scheduler across thousand computers schedule parts send results one computer wan na schedule million searches makes perfect sense scaling quantity probably richest thing scale quantity like network great hundred computers maybe completely wrong one may pick network times slower computers like per computer go times one things happened internet scaling efficiency went future computing inefficiency efficiency scales inefficient scale scaling faster inefficiency bites long dollar value like scaling costs lots money google showed facebook showed everybody showed scale money worth financially think possible like basically entirety earth like computing surface like table computing hedgehog computing like everything really inefficient dumb computing leveraged science fiction books call computronium computronium turn everything computing well elements good anything like gon na make computer iron like silicon carbon like nice structures see rest like people talk well maybe turn sun computer hydrogen little bit helium mean like actually adding computers everything oh okay converting mass universe computer using ironic simulation point view like simulator build mass simulates yeah mean yeah mean ultimately heading towards simulation yeah well think might told story tesla deciding wan na measure current coming battery decided putting resistor putting computer sensor computer faster computer worked chose computer cheaper resistor sure hedgehog costs put ai smart five bucks one computers everywhere hoping would smarter well everything gon na smarter saying inefficient thought better lot dumb things well moore law slowly compact stuff even dumb things smarter us dumb things gon na smarter gon na smart enough talk something really smart well remember big computer chip yeah like inch inch microns thick take much many atoms make computer fit shoebox cooling power problems people working still ca write compelling poetry music understand love fear mortality still winning neither humanity well write books speaking walk along path innovation towards dumb things smarter humans cto tanztorrent two months ago build hardware deep learning build scalable efficient deep learning fascinating space yeah yeah interesting recently thought two kinds computers serial computers run like c programs parallel computers way think parallel computers given parallelism gpus great million pixels modern gpus run program every pixel call shader program like finite element analysis build something make little tiny chunks give chunk computer given chunks parallelism like c programs write linear narrative make go fast make go fast predict branches data fetches run parallel found parallelism ai still trying decide fundamental given parallelism problem way people describe neural networks write pytorch makes graphs yeah might fundamentally different gpu kind parallelism yeah might run gpu program pixels running know depends group pixels say background blue runs really simple program pixel patch face really interesting shader program give impression translucency pixels talk graph right image next image next image run eight million pixels eight million programs every time modern gpus like thread engines get eight million pixels one runs program pixels work graph think graph might totally new way think hardware rajnik dori good conversation given versus found parallelism kind walk got transistors like computers way back stuff scalar data vector data famous vector machines making computers operate matrices right category said next spatial like imagine much data wan na compute data done says send result pile data software better think spatially move data central processor work spatially mean moving space data opposed moving data yeah petabyte data space spread across huge array computers computation somewhere send result computation maybe pointer next program piece data think better word might graph ai neural networks graphs computations send result another computation data transformation merging pooling another computation possible compress say make thing efficient whole process efficient different first fundamental elements graphs things like matrix multiplies convolutions data manipulations data movements gpus emulate things little singles basically running single threaded program nvda calls warp group bunch programs similar together efficiency instruction use higher level take graph say part graph matrix multiplier runs threads model bottom built running programs pixels executing graphs emulation ultimately possible build something natively runs graphs yes tenstore like history effort early days yeah think tenstore started friend mine lebesha bajik first investor kind following talking years fall considering things decided know held conference last year friend organized wanted bring thinkers two people andrei karpathy chris latner andrei gave talk youtube called software think great went programs computers write programs data program computers know like future software data programs networks think true chris working worked llvm low level virtual machine became intermediate representation compilers working another project called mlir intermediate representation essentially graph represent kind computation coordinate large numbers potentially heterogeneous computers would say technically tense torrent two pillars two ideas software representation service executing graph programs hardware designed including hardware piece yeah cool thing relatively small amount money test chip two production chips like super effective team unlike ai startups build hardware run software really wan na fix writing lots software hardware naturally matrix multiply convolution data manipulations data movement processing elements see graph think pretty clever working think called gray call processor introduced last year bunch measures performance talking horses seems outperform trillion operations per second seems outperform nvidia tesla system numbers actually mean real world performance metrics chasing horse racing care well first native language people write ai network programs pytorch pytorch tensorflow couple others think pytorch tensorflow expert know many people switched tensorflow pytorch technical reasons use still awesome still awesome deepest love pytorch currently yeah love may change first thing write programs hardware execute pretty much written pytorch turns graph graph compiler makes graph fractions graph big matrix multiply turn right size chunks run processing elements hooks graph lays data couple representations also simulatable writing code see gon na go machine pretty cool bottom schedules kernels like math data manipulation data movement kernels stuff write little program matrix multiply big matrix multiplier like simd program scheduling one goals write piece pytorch code looks pretty reasonable able compile run hardware without tweak kinds crazy things get performance lot intermediate steps running directly written like gpu write large matrix multiply naively get five peak performance gpu bunch people publish papers read steps goes pretty reasonable well transpose one matrices row ordered column ordered know block put block matrix different sms know groups threads gets little little details like schedule register conflicts call kuda ninjas kuda ninjas love get optimal point either write pre use library good strategy things expert micro architecture program right optimization step way complicated gpu goal write pytorch good pytorch networks evolving know changed convolutional matrix multiply people talking conditional graphs talking large matrices talking sparsity talking problems scale across many many chips native know data item packet like send packet processor gets processed bunch work may send packets processors execute like data flow graph kind methodology got big network chip next second chip ethernet ports hook lots together graph compiler across multiple chips scale comes built scale naturally experience scaling scale run lots interesting problems scaling mountain climb yeah hardware built process software part ethernet well protocol bottom know send ethernet phy protocol basically says send packet point point header bit says processor send basically take packet network put ethernet header send end strip header send local thing pretty straightforward interaction pretty straightforward get million us crazy stuff together yeah fun goal scale like example recently bunch robots home personal pleasure going ever use th storm kinds problems like small inference problems small training problems big training problems big goal big training problems small training problems well one goals scale milliwatts megawatt like really range problems kind ai programs work different levels goal since natural data item packet move around built scale many people small problems like inside phone small problem solve see th storm potentially inside phone well power efficiency local memory local computation way built pretty good lot efficiency able conditional graphs sparsity think complicated networks want go small factor going quite good prove fun problem early days company right couple years said think invested think legit yeah well well also really interesting place like ai world exploding know looked opportunities like build faster processor people want incremental path going happen ai next years kind exciting place part revolutions happening space lots people working lots technical reasons going work well interesting also problem getting basics right like talked customers exciting features point realized lupeche realizing want hear first memory bandwidth local bandwidth compute intensity programmability want know basics power management network ports work basics basics work easy say got great idea know crack people talked wanted say buy pci express card chip buy card plug machine download driver long take get network run right right know real question basic question yeah answer yet trying get goal like hour okay buy test one pretty soon small case training yeah pretty soon month good love idea inside room carpathy andre carpathy chris ladner interesting brilliant people box thinkers also like first principles thinkers well get stuff done get stuff done get projects done talk clearly educate large numbers people created platforms people go stuff yeah clear thinking able communicated kind impressive kind remarkable though yeah fan well let ask talk chris actually lot days one give shout supportive human everybody quite different like great engineers different like sensitive human element way fascinating like one early people stupid podcast say like quit thing also talk whoever hell wan na talk kind legit engineer get like props like mean good leader right kind let little kid thing like go let see turns pretty powerful thing sense used think stepped away google right said think really impressive things chris worked mentioned optimization compiled design stuff llvm also google worked tpu stuff obviously worked swift programming language side talking people work entirety stack time interacting chris knowing guy really impressive inspires well like llvm became de facto platform compilers like amazing good code quality good design choices hit right level abstraction little bit right time right place built new programming language called swift let say adoption resistance became successful know much work google although know typical started tensorflow stuff new wrote lot code point needed refactored development slowed pytorch started little later passed lot work idea mlir people started realize complexity software stack low level ir getting high forcing features level putting much burden splitting multiple pieces one inspirations software stack several intermediate representations executable look transformations lower level think started mlir really got far enough along use interested really excited mlir says like little baby seems profound ideas really useful one things world software gets complicated create right abstraction levels simplify way people work independently different levels would say three projects llvm swift mlir successfully interested gon na next kind way yes either tpu maybe nvidia gpu side tencent torrent think ideas underlying tencent torrent kind graph focused graph centric hardware deep learning centric hardware beat nvidia think possible basically overtake nvidia sure process look like journey look like think well gpus built run shader programs millions pixels run graphs yes hypothesis says way graphs built going really interesting inefficient computing primitives simd program matrix multiply convolution data manipulations fairly extensive like fast transpose program know ever written transpose program ugly slow hardware really well like give example gpu accelerators first started triangles like triangle maps set pixels build easy straightforward build hardware engine find pixels kind weird walk along triangle get edge go back next row walk along decide edge line triangle like half pixel pixel color half pixel half next one called rasterization saying done hardware example operation software program really bad written program rasterization hardware actually less code software program way faster right certain times abstraction rasterize triangle execute graph components graph right thing hardware software boundary hardware naturally gpu really optimized rasterization triangles well well like modern small piece modern gpus still rasterize triangles running game part computation gpu running shader programs single threaded programs pixels graphs honest let say actually know math behind shader shading lighting kind stuff know look like little simple floating point programs complicated ones instructions shader program good intuition could parallelized easily million pixels every single light right comes angle amount light like say line pixels across table amount light pixel subtly different pixel responsible figuring figuring pixel says pixel know angle light know occlusion know color like every single pixel different color every single pixel gets different amount light every single pixel subtly different translucency make look realistic solution run separate program every pixel see thought like reflection place every pixel supposed yeah build reflection map also pixelated thing pixel looking reflection map calculate normal surface per pixel way loads hacks may lower resolution light map reflection map hacks end day per pixel computation happening map graph light computation onto computation could floating point programs convolutions matrices nvidia invested years cuda first hpc got lucky ai trend think going essentially able hardcore pivot see always interesting often big companies hardcore pivot occasionally much know nvidia folks well curious well ultimately well innovated several times also worked really hard mobile worked really hard radios fundamentally gpu company well tried pivot interesting little game play autonomous vehicles right like playing tesla seeing dipping toe kind pivot came platform interesting technically like gpu platform know interesting technically interesting philosophically technically know execution craftsmanship sure get sense think repurposing gpus automotive solution right real pivot build solution like chips inside tesla pretty cheap like mobileye classic work simplest thing building chips nvidia solution chips two chips bolt loads really expensive drams really different approach mobileye fit let say automotive factor added features economically viable nvidia said take biggest thing gon na go make work also influenced like waymo whole bunch autonomous startups server trunk think well watts okay replacing driver elon approach port cheap enough put every single tesla whether turn autonomous driving mobileye like need fit bomb cost structure car companies may sell gps bucks bomb like well mobileye seems like neural networks citizens like computation start yeah cv problem classic cv found stoplights lines really good never mean know happening never fully pivoted mean like nvidia thing opposed look new tesla work like neural networks ground right yeah even tesla started lot cv stuff andre basically eliminating know move everything network without like confidential stuff sitting porch looking world looking work andre elon tesla autopilot like trajectory things going hardware side well making serious progress like videos people driving beta stuff like taken pretty complicated intersections still intervention per drive mean autopilot current autopilot tesla use every day full beta like going making progress taking longer anybody thought know wonder hardware three enough computing two five hundred yeah thought probably enough pretty well yeah one thing data set gets bigger training gets better interesting thing sort train build arbitrary size network solves problem refactor network thing afford ship right goal build network fits phone build something actually works make effective hardware seem much better couple years ago well one really important thing also well iterate quickly means like one time deployment one building constantly iterating network trying automate many steps possible right actually principles software like mentioned andre mean know actual description software high level philosophical specifics interesting thing actually looks real world think andre calls data engine like iterative improvement thing neural network stuff fails bunch things learns constantly discovering edge cases much like data engineering like figuring kind talking tensorflow data landscape walk along data landscape way constantly improving neural network feels like central piece two pieces like find edge cases work define something goes get data constraint whether label like amazing thing like stuff unsupervised essentially infinite amount data obviously infinite amount data available cars people successfully driving current pipelines mostly running labeled data human limited becomes unsupervised right create unlimited amount data scale networks may use data might way big cars transformation unlimited data know exactly want turn something fits car process gon na happen place every time get place unlimited data software unlimited data training networks stuff without humans writing code ultimately also trying discover like saying formulation problem unsupervised formulation problem like driving really interesting thing look scene data successful human driver scene one second later little piece data use like training currently even though tesla says using open question far solve driving piece data well comaai comaai question much data comaai good data engine example tesla organization data mean far know talked george data question much data needed say infinite loosely question said know think still open question right order magnitude compute necessary like elon said chip enough full need another order magnitude think nobody actually knows answer question like confidence elon yeah see another funny thing learn drive infinite amounts data learn drive intellectual framework understands physics color horizontal surfaces laws roads experience manipulating environment like many factors go learn drive like driving subset conceptual framework cars right teaching drive driving data never teach human teach human kinds interesting things like language like watch kinds stuff going well think previous time talked poetically disagreed naive notion humans think humans make whole driving thing really difficult yeah right said humans move slow ballistics problem ballistics humans ballistics problem like poetry possible driving indeed purely ballistics problem think probably right way think still still continue surprise damn pedestrians cyclists humans cars yeah gon na one compensating things like driving intuition humans going cameras radars attention problem car comes attention problem cameras right bunch features wipe whole class accidents right emergency braking radar especially gets ai enhanced eliminate collisions right problems unexpected things think human intuition helping cars also set hardware features even close key thing course wipe huge number kind accidents might way safer human driver even humans still problem hard figure yeah probably happen autonomous cars small number accidents humans would avoided wipe get rid bulk think tesla dojo efforts bigger tesla general kind like tense torrent trying innovate like dichotomy like company try scratch build neural network training hardware well first think great need lots experiments right lots startups working pursuing different things started dojo sort like unconstrained computer solution go large training problems fun stuff like said well watt board cool well go talk guys spacex think watts really small number big number brilliant people working curious see come could tell know pivoted times since left cooling seem big problem like elon said like wan na thing unless way better alternative whatever alternative way better like racks gpus yeah thing like tesla autonomous driving hardware serving one software stack hardware team software team tightly coupled building general purpose ai solution many different customers many different needs something andre said think amazing years ago like vision recommendation language completely different disciplines said people literally could talk three years ago neural networks different neural networks recently converging one set networks vary lot size obviously vary data vary outputs technology converged good bit yeah transformers behind seems like could applied video could applied lot like really simple like literally replace letters pixels vision amazing size actually improves thing bigger gets compute throw better gets data better gets start wonder well fundamental thing another step fundamental understanding kind computation really interesting us humans wan na believe kind thing achieve conceptual understanding saying like figure physics maybe maybe maybe well worse understand physics ways ca understand liked stephen wolfram talk said know three generations physics physics reasoning well big things fall faster small things right reasoning physics equations like know number programs world solved single equations relatively low almost programs know one line code maybe hundred million lines code said going physics equation project cool might point two generations physics reasoning habit like animals know know things fall know birds fly know predators know know solve differential equation cut accelerating know curving animal path yeah know gods right right know five generations software says programming things last step data going physics steven wolfram comp explainable explainable actually reason see even limit like something beyond mean usually like usually hierarchy like well step step step qualitatively different conceptually different obvious know six right number hierarchy steps seven eight well probably impossible us comprehend something beyond thing explainable yeah thing know understands thing explainable us conceive next one like sure limit like brain hurts sad story look brain interesting illustrative example work testor trying design deep learning architectures think brain maybe hardware designer perspective could change something brain would change funny question like would brain really weird like know cerebral cortex think thinking like six seven neurons thick yeah like weird like big networks way bigger like way deeper seems odd know thinking input generates result lose goes really fast ca generates output interesting turns input brain point mull things days many trips brain right like know milliseconds something get seven levels neurons forget number exactly searches brain clearly looks like kind graph neuron connections talks ones locally computationally intense also sparse computations across pretty big area lot messy biological type things meaning like first mechanical chemical electrical signals going asynchronicity signals like lot variability seems continuous messy mess biology unclear whether good thing bad thing good thing need run entirety evolution well gon na start basic bacteria create something imagine could build brain layers would better worse connections less connections know know level brains optimized changing things like know hold like seven numbers head like million lot ca like floating point processor compute anything want like see properly like would kind fun ca see four eight dimensions like three kind drag like hard math transforms multiple dimensions know could imagine rain architecture know could enhance whole bunch features would know really useful thinking things possible limitations describing actually essential like constraints essential creating like depth intelligence like ability reason know yeah hard say cause like brain clearly parallel processor know billion neurons talking relatively low clock rate produces something looks like serial thought process serial narrative head true people famously visual thinkers like think relatively visual thinker imagine object rotate head look people say think way recently read article people say voice head talk know like well thinking describe something visual curious saying dedicated hardware holding information like know numbers million numbers like would distract us ability form kind singular identity like dissipates somehow right maybe know future humans many identities higher level organization actually lots things parallel yeah reason thinking modularly reason ca multiple consciousnesses one brain yeah maybe way make faster area computation could still unified feel still way ability parallel stuff time could definitely improved could improved yeah okay well pretty good right actually people give enough credit thing pretty nice fact right ends seem give nice like spark beauty whole experience know know improved easily could beautiful know mean mean ways ca imagine whole point would able imagine fact imagine ways could beautiful means know ian banks stories super smart ais mostly live world call infinite fun create arbitrary worlds interact story interact normal world smart kinds stuff given mind talk million humans time slow reasons artificial story interested people stuff mostly live land thinking inclination think ability create infinite fun fun sad many things imagine able make star move planets around yeah yeah imagine life fun actually able slippery slope fun would even meaning consistently desensitize infinite amounts fun sadness dark stuff makes fun think could russian could fun makes fun sadness makes bittersweet yeah true fun could thing makes fun think expansion biology side bci interfaces got chance check neuralink stuff super interesting like humans thoughts manifest action like kid shooting rifle super fun driving mini bike things computer games think lot kids became thing want fly plane physical interaction imagine could imagine stuff happens right like really richly interestingly like kind dream like dreams funny like control awareness dreams like realistic looking realistic depends dream also manipulate possible odd fact nobody understands hilarious think possible expand capability computing sure interesting hardware designer perspective think present totally new challenges kind hardware required hardware standalone computing well thinking today computer games rendered gpus right right seen gan stuff right trained neural networks render realistic images pixels triangles shaders light maps nothing future graphics probably ai right yes ai heavily trained lots real data right interface ai renderer right say render cat wo say well tall cat big render cat might say well little bigger little smaller make tabby shorter hair could tweak like amount data send interact powerful ai renderer could low question bringing computer interfaces need render onto screen render onto brain like directly bandwidth well could ways mean eyes really good sensors could render onto screen could feel like participating gon na like oculus kind stuff gon na good projection eyes think real slowly solving problems suspect renderer information head also ai mediated able give cues really want depth kinds stuff like brain partly faking visual field right like eyes twitching around notice occasionally blank notice kinds things like think see really see fabricated yeah yeah peripheral vision fascinating ai renderer trained understand exactly see kind things enhance realism experience could super real actually know limits obviously brain interface goes inside visual cortex better way eyes possible lot neurons maybe even cooler really cool thing infinite fun referring brains seem limited like said also plastic plastic yeah yeah interesting combination interesting open question limits neuroplasticity like flexible thing really tested know experiment put like pressure pad somebody head visual transducer pressurize somebody slowly learned see yep like especially young age throw lot like complete like arbitrarily expand computing power connected internet directly somehow yeah answer probably yes problem biology ethics like mess like us humans perhaps unwilling take risks directions full uncertainty population unwilling take risks rushing risks unaided infrastructure whatsoever fun happens society huge transformations last couple thousand years yeah funny got chance interact matthew johnson johns hopkins large scale study psychedelics becoming gotten chance interact community scientists working psychedelics opened door call psychonauts people like said like care know science behind taking spaceship first mars psychedelics interesting sense another dimension like said way explore limits human mind like thing capable kind like dream detach know exactly science detach reality mind images mind able conjure mind goes weird places like entities appear somehow freudian type like trauma probably connected somehow start like weird vivid worlds actively dream like six hours dreams night like really useful time know reason knock sometimes like anxiety inducing kind like pragmatic like nightmare type dreams nothing fun nothing fun nothing fun try unfortunately mostly fun waking world limited amount fun limited either yeah talk yeah need instructions yeah like manual might looked ask elon dream know years ago read know like book know become aware dreams worked like trick know imagine see hands look got somewhat good like mostly thinking things working problems prep go sleep like pull mind things wan na work think let say greatly improves chances work sleeping also know basically asked remember often remember within dream outside dreams well bring dreaming remember wake meditative practice say know prepare like go know sleep still gnashing teeth random thing happened really interested dream really interesting direct dreams somewhat prepping yeah wanted try really interesting like important interesting like guy send email kind like stupid worry stuff like fundamental problems actually concerned prepping interesting things worried books reading know great conversation adventure wan na like lot space seems work know percentage interesting dreams memories went source able deconstruct like best ideas came process core like people know walk think people like shower best ideas hit talk like newton apple hitting head found long time ago process things somewhat slowly like college friends could study last minute get next day ca always front loaded work like problems early know finals like last three days would look book want know cause like new fact day finals may screw understanding thought knew goal always get give time soak used know remember like calculus would amazing dreams surfaces normal know calculating gradient like come like really fun like visual got cycles useful filter ideas like like process brainstorming lots ideas happen like people lots ideas let sit yeah let sit let breathe little bit reduce practice like point really really work like real right great attention like open know precise ideas sit mind like years sure interesting way generate ideas let sit let sit think ideas know funny yeah think know creativity discipline something slow thinkers room suppose people like said like like yeah really interesting much diversity people think know fast slow well remember like know super good remembering facts processes methods like engineering went penn state almost engineering tests open book could remember page formula soon saw formula could remember whole method learned yeah funny people could know swatched friends like flipping book trying find formula even knowing done much work would open book page half could see whole thing visually yeah know learn figure function optimally friend always concerned know came ideas lots ideas said sort popped like working something idea like come awareness like like like brain works little murky go voice head obvious visualizations like visualize something happen yeah know say know visualize volcano easy right actually look like visualize visualize point see much eyes see colors thing visualizing yeah like shape texture color also conceptual visualization like actually visualizing visualizing volcano like peripheral vision think see whole thing yeah yeah yeah good way say know kind almost peripheral vision visualizations like ghosts know work get pretty high level detail somehow walk along visualizations come idea weird thinking solving problems like putting information exercising stuff know sort teasing area understand know almost feel process happening like know sometimes working really hard something like get really hot sleeping like got blank throw wake blanks thrown floor every time wake think wow great able reverse engineer hell happened well sometimes vivid dreams sometimes kind like say like shadow thinking sort feeling going stuff obvious amazing mind little experiments never know thought always thought like river ca ride right prep understandable meditation really helps got start figuring need learn language mind multiple levels abstractions right somewhat comprehensible observable feelable whatever right word yeah alone ride ride ask hardware engineer working networks consciousness hell thing little weird quirk particular computing device something fundamental really need crack open build good computers ever think consciousness like feels like something know really weird mean everything weird first half second behind reality right narrative happened already done stuff time conscious consciousness generally single threaded thing know brain billion neurons running crazy parallel thing really big sorting thing going also seems really reflective sense create space head really see anything right photons hit eyes gets turned signals goes multiple layers neurons curious looks glassy looks glassy like resolution vision high yet go processing looks nothing like vision like theater mind right world heads literally isolated behind sensors look speculate speculate alternatives problem solve many things going process lagging reality single threaded even though underlying thing like massively parallel curious imagine building ai computer wanted replicate humans well huge arrays neural networks apparently six seven deep hilarious even remember seven numbers think upgrade lot right somewhere would train network create basically world live right like tell stories world perceiving well create world tell stories world many dimensions like side jobs like emotional structure like biological structure seems hierarchical like hungry dominates thinking mad dominates thinking like know important consciousness certainly disrupts intrudes consciousness like lots structure like dwell past like think future like imagine like fantasize right somewhat circular observation thing call consciousness created computer system things created worldviews created future alternate histories dwell past events accurately consciousness spring like naturally well would look feel conscious like seem conscious know external observer sense think thing looks conscious conscious like like engineering kind question think like want engineer consciousness okay engineer something looks conscious difference something well consciousness super effective way manage affairs yeah yeah social element yeah well gives us planning system huge amount stuff like talking like reason talk really fast modeling really high level detail consciousness required well components together manifest consciousness make intelligent beings want interact like wondering thinking looking forward seeing interact interesting surprising fascinating probably feel conscious like perceive conscious know never know another fun question computing perspective trying create something let ask aliens aliens think intelligent alien civilizations think technology computing ai bots chips nature yeah got idea mean lots aliens awfully quiet know speculation seems enough planets lot intelligent life planet seems quite different know dolphins seem plausibly understandable octopuses seem understandable live longer year maybe would running planet seem really smart neural architecture completely different knows perceive things mean question us intelligent beings might able perceive kinds intelligence become sufficiently different us understand dolphins live current constrained world geometry geometry defines certain amount physics like time work seems work many things seem like whole bunch input parameters another conscious yes like biological biological things seem relatively narrow temperature range right know organics stable cold hot know specify list things input soon make really smart know beings go solve think ability numbers time think end dimensions funny science fiction book society uploaded matrix point beings matrix thought wonder intelligent life whole bunch work figure like make physical thing matrix made little spaceship traveled another planet got like life running around intelligent life figured huge know organic matrix planet inside intelligent beings uploaded matrix everywhere intelligent life soon got smart upleveled something way interesting geometry yeah escaped whatever uplevel better essence think intelligent tend like thought experiment organism like humans organisms like notion like richard dawkins memes ideas organisms like using minds evolve like like meat receptacles ideas breed multiply maybe aliens yeah jordan peterson line says think ideas ideas yeah right good line know phenomenon groupthink many things constrain us think examine completely owned ideas completely sucked groupthink part responsibility human escape kind phenomena one creative tension things constructed still observe think make choices level constrained useful time could group society part becomes collectively even interesting outside observer think wow lexes running around really independent ideas created something even interesting aggregate know lenses look situation could inspiration think constraints right small little quirk history seems like related jordan peterson like mentioned gone rough stuff comment make roughness human journey ups downs well became expert benza withdrawal like took benza aspines point interact gaba circuits know reduce anxiety hundred things like actually known list everything interact many parts body habituate dependency like drug dependency trying get high metabolic dependency discontinue funny thing called kindling stop go know horrible withdrawal symptoms go back level wo stable unfortunately happened deeply integrated kinds systems body literally changes size numbers neurotransmitter sites brain process called ashton protocol taper slowly two years people go goes unbelievable hell jordan went seemed worse advice doctors know stop taking take disaster got yeah pretty tough seems quite bit better intellectually see brain clicking back together spent lot time never seen anybody suffer much well brain also like powerhouse right wonder brain able think deeply world suffer kinds withdrawals like know watched videos people going withdrawal seem suffer unbelievably know work goes everybody funny math doctor said best tell know standard recommendations take month taper couple weeks many doctors prescribe endlessly protocol common right something like people taper know half people difficulty get okay severe difficulty difficulty one really bad stories people heartbreaking tough put fault doctors know hell know hard say one commonly prescribed things like one doctor said happens prescribed reason hard time getting protocol basically says either crazy dependent get kind pushed different treatment regime drug addict psychiatric patient like one doctor said know prescribed years thinking helping patients realized really harming know awareness slowly coming fact casually prescribed people horrible bloody scary people stable life like know another one drugs benzo long range real impacts personality people talk benzo bubble get disassociated reality friends little bit really terrible mind terrifying talking infinite possibility fun like infinite possibility suffering one dangers like expansion human mind like wonder possible human experiences intelligent computer mostly fun mostly suffering like brute force expand set possibilities like going run trouble terms like torture suffering maybe human brain protecting us much possible pain suffering maybe space pain like much larger could possibly imagine world balance know literature religion stuff know struggle good evil balanced finely tuned reasons complicated long philosophical conversation speaking balance complicated wonder living one important moments human history particular virus seems like pandemics least ability kill human population worst fascinating many viruses world many mean viruses basically run world sense around long time everywhere seem extremely powerful distributed kind way time intelligent even living like high level thoughts virus like terms fascinated terrified someone believe frameworks right like one evolution like evolved creatures right yes one things evolution hyper competitive competitive sense evil competitive sense endless variation variations work better time many levels competition like multicellular life partly exists competition different kinds life forms know sex partly exists scramble genes genetic variation invasion bacteria viruses endless like read funny statistic like density viruses bacteria ocean really high one third bacteria die every day viruses invading like one third wow like know number true like amount competition going stunning theory age slowly accumulate bacterias viruses immune system kind goes slowly kills us feels peaceful human perspective sit back able relaxed conversation wars going like right harboring many bacteria ones many parasites helpful modifying behavior really wild particular manifestation unusual demographic hit political response engendered healthcare response engendered technology gendered kind wild yeah communication twitter led every level kind stuff everything level yeah usually kills life big extinctions caused meteors volcanoes one worried opposed human created bombs launch solar flares another good one occasionally solar flares hit planet nature yeah pretty wild another historic moment perhaps outside perhaps within space frameworks think happened guess couple weeks ago know paying attention gamestop wall street bets super fun really fascinating kind theme conversation today like neural networks cool large number people distributed way almost kind fund able take powerful elites elite hedge funds centralized powers overpower thoughts whole saga know enough finance like elon robin hood guy talked yeah think well robin hood guy know finance system worked clear right treating people sell transactions black box suddenly somebody called said hey black box calling transaction volume means need put billion right like billion like even make money trades owe billion sponsoring trade set abstractions understand happens chip design buy wafers tsmc samsung intel say works like design based chip comes back work suddenly start open black boxes transistors really work like said real issue whole set things created opportunity somebody spotted people spot kinds opportunities time flash crashes always short squeezes fairly regular every ceo know hates shorts trying manipulate stock way make money deprive value company investors fact stocks short hilarious happened know actually know serious hedge funds hedge funds hedge funds actually made lot money guess know really happened lot players know happened people probably made money people talking yeah think something mean cool kind elon kind conversationalist like first principles questions like hell happened basic questions like something shady going know parties involved basic questions everybody wants know yeah like hyper competitive world right transactions like buying selling stock trust event know trust company represented properly know bought stock think gon na go trust regulations solid inside kinds places know humans trust know exposed let say weak points system know gon na get corrected know close real story know suspicion listen guy like little like hmm think know business many businesses like layer really stable stop paying attention pay attention stuff bugging new pay attention stuff seems work time know sky blue every day california every rains everybody like somebody go bring lawn furniture know like getting wet know getting wet yeah always work guy blue like days know part problem vlad ceo robinhood scaling talking lot unexpected things happen scaling think scaling forces return fundamentals well interesting buy sell stocks scaling know stocks move certain range buy stock lose amount money short market lose lot benefit like weird cause know cost function whatever right word trading market actually capitalized downside got outside certain range whether something nefarious happened idea point financial risk customers way outside financial capacity understanding system work clearly weak represent know know person listened like could surprise question like guys called know sounded like treating stuff black box maybe maybe whole pile experts somewhere else going know yep mean one qualities good leader fire perform means think clearly speak clearly dropped ball things understand problem quickly learn understand problem basic level like hell happened guess know level amateurs trading know experts slash insiders slash people know special information outsiders versus insiders yeah insiders know guess next time happens make money insiders always win well tools incentive mean always happens like outsiders fun insiders numbers outsiders interesting thing could new chapter well numbers insiders like different kind numbers different kind numbers could new era know least expect bunch redditors could know know millions people get surprise attack next one surprise think crowd people planning next attack see surprise ca game like could large number games play agile know expert right good question space games restricted yeah system complicated could relatively unrestricted also like know last couple financial crashes know set know sets derivative events know nassim tlaib know saying trying lower volatility short run creating tail events systems always evolve towards always crash like know star low ramp plateau crash hundred percent effective long run let ask advice put profound hat bunch young folks listen thing good reason whatsoever undergraduate students maybe high school students maybe young folks young heart looking next steps take life advice would give young person today life maybe career also life general get good stuff well get know right get good something actually interested love get good really got find waste time stuff boring bland numbing right let old people screw well people get talked kinds shit racking huge student debts much crap going drains time drains energy eric weinstein thesis older generation let go trapping young people think truth yeah sure old mean stop thinking know lots really original old people old person conscious fall ruts hear young people spouting opinions sounds like come fox news cnn think captured group thinking memes opposed thinking find repeating everybody else saying gon na good life world works seems safe puts great jeopardy well boring unhappy long take find thing fun oh know fun person since pretty little everything gone couple periods depression life good reason reason make sense yeah like things hard like go mental transitions high school really depressed year think first midlife crisis kind thought like working job loved going work time consumed escape depression answer well friend mine asked working ass said work life balance like work friends family personal time balancing said work family tried find time sleep like personal time passionate time like know young people often passionate work certainly like need space life different things creates makes resistant whole deep dips depression kind thing yeah well get know meditation helps physical something physically intense helps like weird places mind goes kind thing like happen like triggers like things cause mind go different places kind thing like events like upbringing better worse whether parents great people come adulthood kinds emotional burdens see people bloody stiff restrained think know world fundamentally negative like maybe unexplored territory yeah afraid something definitely afraid quite things got ta go face like worst thing could happen gon na die right like inevitable might well get like death rate like people worried virus know human condition pretty deadly something embarrassment competed lot life think introspective thing afraid like humiliated think nobody cares like person planet cares humiliated exactly like really useless thought like humiliated something happened room full people walk think one second maybe somebody told funny story somebody else dissipates throughout yeah yeah know mean really embarrassed shit nobody cared yeah funny thing worst thing ultimately yeah cage get yeah like thing find something like determined break cause otherwise know accumulate kind junk die know mess goal guess like cage within cage guess goal die biggest possible cage well ideally cage well people get enlightened got great found know course yeah either know great sales pitch like enlightened people write books kinds stuff good way sell book give never met somebody thought kill like like mental clarity humor feel like living bigger cage still think cage still cage secretly suspect always cage nothing outside universe nothing outside cage work work work bunch companies led lot amazing teams sure ever like early stages startup advice somebody wants startup build company like build strong team engineers passionate want solve big problem like specifically point well really good stuff going lead build team better really interested people work think people solution problem two things right one people work say quite successful startups pretty clear founders know anything people like idea powerful propelled suspect somewhere early hired people understood people cause people really need lot care feeding collaborate work together feel engaged work hard like startups producing people like nimble legacy bunch people depressed life showing startups lot advantages way like steve jobs talked idea players b players know know formulation yeah organizations get taken b player leaders often really underperform rsu players said big organizations much work many people happy like leadership big idea people consider menial jobs need place need organization values rewards let take leadership got need organization resistant early days notion steve like one b player room players like destructive whole seen happen know like always true like run people clearly b players think players loud voice table make lots demands people like know wan na work cool people cool shit tell go get done like people skills like kind person met really great people love working biggest id people productive ever show get done know create connection community people value pretty diverse think recipe got ta ask love heard love thing yeah think solution depression trying like said delight people occasion trying sell book writing book love writing book love afraid got ta said really write book know management philosophy short book well one pretty well role think love family friendship kind human stuff play successful life exceptionally successful space like running teams building cool shit world creating amazing things love get way love help family get way family help friendship want engineer answer please first love functional right functional way habituate environment actually jordan told jordan peterson told line go life get used everything except things love remain new like really useful know like people children dogs know trees pay much attention kids monitor really closely like go little bit love smart gon na successful parent notice right away habituate things love wan na successful work love gon na put time somebody else somebody else loves like cause new interesting lets go next level thing function generates newness novelty surprises know kinds things really interesting like people figured lots frameworks know like like humans seem go partnership go know interest like somebody suddenly somebody interesting infatuated love know different people ideas parental love mature love like go cycle keeps us together know super functional creating families creating communities making support somebody despite fact love like really enriching know balance scheme work think may optimizing work potential love work family friends things care brain well balanced like everybody knows experience worked something week went home took two days came back odds working thing picking right left zero brain refactored love great like changes color light room like creates spaciousness different helps think makes strong bukowski line love fog dissipates first light reality morning depressing think way around lasts well like said function thing generates light actually enlivens world creates interest power strengths go something well like like like sounds like know like physical love emotional love intellectual love spiritual love right thing kind nope differentiate maybe problem book refine little bit different chapters yeah different chapters different layers thing stack physical people people people addicted physical love idea emotional intellectual love know things think different true could different guess ultimate goal well want something bigger interesting find components differentiate glom together like people time yeah modularity get abstraction layers right room breathe well maybe write forward book love afterwards afterwards really tried feel like life made lot progress book well things life love yeah yeah know right modular quite multiple things person thing yeah depending moment day yeah like bukowski described moment go love different kind love yeah thing yeah transition happens read owner manual believed would said oh happened mean love different kind love maybe something better grow old regret used sad right learned lot things like future self actually interesting possibly delightful mad kid love next person like super fun happens possibility yeah right lot fun long lasting stuff yeah meaning thing kind fun deeper kind fun surprising like thing like surprises never know gon na happen look carefully work think yeah see surprises happen looking branching perspective mentioned regrets regrets trajectory oh yeah course yeah painful wan na hear painful stuff say like terms working people people stuff like especially bit nefarious took personally also felt personal lot times humans mess act stuff psychologist heard long time ago said tend think somebody something really front much got interested work people think probably analyze understand little bit stuff way less surprised bad way less hurt react way less sort expect everybody got shit yeah much much like something think embarrassed nobody cares somebody really mad odds getting mad way pattern learned maybe help care enough could see coming step way like wish way better bit hothead regret said steve feature bug yeah well using counter orderliness would crush work well maybe think vision big enough like got pissed stuff sure steve yeah know amazing effect creating trillion dollar company like got pissed left made enemies yeah hard like really understand politics worked apple steve master player politics staff would survive definitely part culture companies say political fun games compared apple people apple bad people operate politically higher level like oh somebody said something bad somebody else politics know strategies accomplishing goals sometimes know dead bodies enemies know sophistication yeah game thrones sophistication like big time factor rather know wow requires lot control emotions think bigger strategy way behave yeah effective sense coordinating thousands people really hard things many people understand much less participating creates kinds drama problems solution political nature like convince people leverage motivate get rid know like many layers interesting even though let say may tough evil unless know use skill evil purposes people obviously skill set operates wish know interested know sort like engineer thing know times could way bigger impact know knew paid attention knew yeah human layer stack yeah human political power know expression layer stack complicated lots know mean people good amazing good let say relatively kind oriented good direction really feel get lots stuff done coordinate things never thought possible people like also pretty hard edges know heavy lift wish spent time younger maybe ready know wide eyed kid years still bit kid yeah know hope legacy book like hitchhiker guide galaxy like one sentence entry jim butler like guy lived point many know many people remembered one sparkling little human creatures big impact world hope remembered daughter trying get edited wikipedia page say legend guru took put back think probably biggest thing probably best part legacy got sister excited like trying put references articles top calling eyes kids legend well pretty skeptical hope better like dad yeah super kind stuff super fun terms big legends stuff care care really care engineer thinking building big pyramid debate friend whether pyramids craters cooler realized craters everywhere built couple pyramids years ago remember still talking think would cool easy build oh know actually know built great either agi aliens could involved think think gon na figure quite things basics civil engineering guess hope legacy pyramids would would cool wikipedia page know getting updated daughter periodically like two things would pretty much make jim huge honor talking hope talk many times future ca wait see tense torrent ca wait use ca wait revolutionize yet another space computing huge honor talk thanks talking today fun thanks listening conversation jim keller thank sponsors athletic greens nutrition drink brooklyn sheets expressvpn bell campbell meat click sponsor links get discount support podcast let leave words alan turing imagine anything create impossible thank listening hope see next time', 'think possible physics exploits trying find arranging kind crazy quantum mechanical system somehow gives buffer overflow somehow gives rounding error floating point synthetic intelligences kind like next stage development know leads like point suspect universe kind puzzle synthetic ais uncover puzzle solve following conversation andrei kapothe previously director ai tesla openai stanford one greatest scientists engineers educators history artificial intelligence lex friedman podcast support please check sponsors dear friends andrei kapothe neural network seem surprisingly good job learning neural network mathematical abstraction brain would say originally developed end day mathematical expression fairly simple mathematical expression get basically sequence matrix multiplies really dot products mathematically nonlinearity thrown simple mathematical expression got knobs many knobs many knobs knobs loosely related basically synapses brain trainable modifiable idea need find setting knobs makes neural net whatever want like classify images much mystery would say might think basically want endow much meaning respect works really complicated mathematical expression knobs knobs need proper setting something desirable yeah poetry collection letters spaces make us feel certain way way get large number knobs together whether inside brain inside computer seem surprise us power yeah think fair basically underselling lot definitely get surprising emergent behaviors neural nets large enough trained complicated enough problems like say example next word prediction massive data set internet neural nets take pretty surprising magical properties yeah think kind interesting much get even simple mathematical formalism brain right talking next word prediction something interesting well definitely kind generative model prompted yes giving prompt kind responding generative way perhaps little bit like adding extra prompts memory inside head well definitely feels like referencing kind declarative structure memory putting together prompt giving away answer much said said nothing basically right actually look words ever said life search probably said lot words order yeah could mean using phrases common et cetera remixing pretty sort unique sentence end day right definitely like ton remixing like magnus carlsen said rated whatever pretty decent think talking giving enough credit nuts seem best intuition emergent behavior mean kind interesting simultaneously underselling also feel like element like actually kind incredible get much emergent magical behavior despite simple mathematically think kind like two surprising statements kind juxtaposed together think basically actually fairly good optimizing neural nets give hard enough problem forced learn interesting solutions optimization solutions basically emergent properties interesting wisdom knowledge knobs representation knobs make sense intuitively large number knobs hold representation captures deep wisdom data looked lot knobs lot knobs somehow speaking concretely one neural nets people excited right gpts basically next word prediction networks consume sequence words internet try predict next word train large enough data set basically prompt neural nets arbitrary ways ask solve problems tell make look like trying solve kind mathematical problem continue think solution based seen internet often solutions look remarkably consistent look correct potentially still think brain side neural nets abstraction mathematical abstraction brain still draw wisdom biological neural networks even bigger question big fan biology biological computation impressive thing biology computers yet gap would say definitely much hesitant analogies brain think would see potentially field feel like certainly way neural networks started everything stemmed inspiration brain end day artifacts get training arrived different optimization process optimization process gave rise brain think think complicated alien artifact something different sorry neural nets training complicated alien artifact make analogies brain think optimization process gave rise different brain kind setup evolution optimization basically amounts compression objective massive amount data ok artificial neural networks compression biological neural networks survive really anything agent system running long time said evolution found useful predict predictive model brain think brain utilizes something looks like part lot gadgets gizmos value functions ancient nuclei trying make survive reproduce everything else whole thing embryogenesis built single cell mean code inside dna builds entire organism arms head legs pretty well possible learning going kind computation going building process mean know look entirety history life earth think interesting invention origin life jumping eukaryotes mammals humans almost sapiens origin intelligence highly complex intelligence continuation kind process certainly would say extremely remarkable story briefly learning recently way actually almost start formation earth conditions entire solar system everything arranged jupiter moon habitable zone everything active earth turning material start abiogenesis everything pretty remarkable story sure pick single unique piece find interesting guess artificial intelligence researcher probably last piece lots animals building technological society seems happened quickly seems happened recently something interesting happened fully understand almost understand everything else think intuitively understand exactly part quick explanations interesting one continuation kind process nothing special humans would deeply understanding would interesting think special obvious already written code would greater greater intelligence emerging explanation something truly special happened something like rare event whether like crazy rare event like space odyssey would see say like invention fire richard wrangham says beta males deciding clever way kill alpha males collaborating optimizing collaboration aspect really constrained resources trying survive collaboration aspect created complex intelligence seems like natural algorithm evolution process could possibly magical thing happened like rare thing would say humans actually human level intelligence actually really rare thing universe yeah hesitant say rare way definitely seems like kind like punctuated equilibrium lots exploration certain leaps sparse leaps course like origin life would one dna sex eukaryotic life endosymbiosis event archaeon ate bacteria whole thing course emergence consciousness seems like definitely sparse events massive amount progress made yeah kind hard pick one think humans unique got ask many intelligent alien civilizations think intelligence different similar yeah preoccupied question quite bit recently basically fermi paradox thinking reason actually interested origin life fundamentally trying understand common technological societies space study think quite lot heard agree feels like see earth difficult yeah especially get details used think origin life magical rare event read books like example nick lane vital question life ascending et cetera really gets really makes believe rare basic chemistry active earth alkaline vents lots alkaline waters mixing ocean proton gradients little porous pockets alkaline vents concentrate chemistry basically steps little pieces start understand actually crazy could see happen systems really takes geology primitive life makes feel like actually pretty plausible also origin life actually fairly fast formation earth remember correctly hundred million years something like basically possible life actually arose makes feel like constraint limiting variable life actually fairly common interesting think currently think major basically quite lot life basically brings way reconcile fact found anyone ca see ca observe quick brief comment nick lane lot biologists talked really seem think jump bacteria complex organisms hardest jump eukaryotic life basically yeah get much knowledgeable intricacies biology seems like crazy many single cell organisms much time surely difficult like billion years even long time really bacteria constrained resources battling sure invent complex understand like move hello world program invent function something like yeah yeah feel like see origin life would intuition hardest thing hardest thing happens quickly got everywhere yeah maybe dumb see well really good mechanisms seeing life mean expert preface getting want meet expert alien intelligence communicate suspicious ability find intelligences find like radio waves example terrible power drops basically one r square remember reading current radio waves would ones broadcasting would measurable devices today like like tenth light year away like even basically tiny distance really need like targeted transmission massive power directed somewhere picked long distances think ability measure amazing think probably civilizations big question build binomial probes interstellar travel across entire galaxy current answer probably interstellar travel like really hard interstellar medium want move close speed light going encountering bullets along way even like tiny hydrogen atoms little particles dust basically massive kinetic energy speeds basically need kind shielding cosmic radiation like brutal really hard thinking maybe interstellar travel extremely hard slow like billions years build hard feels like billion years away might go slowly potentially example space right opposed close speed light suspicious basically ability measure life suspicious ability permeate space galaxy across galaxies way currently see way around yeah kind mind blowing think trillions intelligent alien civilizations kind slowly traveling space meet meet go war collaborate independent like little pockets well statistically trillions surely pockets close enough get happen close yeah close enough see see something definitely complex life like see something probably going severe like intensely aggressively motivated figure hell try meet would first instinct try like generational level meet defend would instinct president united states scientist know hat prefer question yeah think question really hard say like example us lots primitive life forms earth next us kinds ants everything else share space hesitant impact trying protect default amazing interesting dynamical systems took long time evolve interesting special know want destroy default like complex dynamical systems took lot time evolve think like preserve afford like think would true galactic resources would think kind incredible interesting story took time took billion years unravel want destroy could see two aliens talking earth right saying big fan complex dynamical systems think value preserve basically video game watch show tv show watch yeah think would need good reason think destroy like destroy ant farms actually really direct competition right accidentally plenty resources would destroy something interesting precious well scientific perspective might probe might interact lightly might want learn something right wonder could certain physical phenomena think physical phenomena actually interacting us poke finger see happens think interesting scientists alien scientists happened seeing today snapshot basically result huge amount computation like billion years something like could initiated aliens could computer running program okay power okay sure least would would pick planet conditions based understanding chemistry prerequisites life would seed life run right like would observe protect mean hell good tv show good scientific experiment physical simulation right maybe evolution like actually running efficient way understand computation compute stuff understand life life looks like branches take make kind feel weird part science experiment maybe everything science experiment change anything us science experiment um know two descendants apes talking inside science experiment suspicious idea like deliberate panspermia described cernus see divine intervention way historical record right feel like story books like nick lane books sort makes sense makes sense life arose earth uniquely yeah need reach exotic explanations right sure npcs inside video game observe divine intervention either might npcs running kind code maybe eventually currently npcs really dumb running gpts maybe like okay really suspicious hell famously tweeted looks like bombard earth photons emit roadster like hitchhiker guide galaxy would summarize story earth book mostly harmless think possible stories like paragraph long sentence long earth could summarized done computation like possible full earth book right probably ending mean going end earth could end kinds ways end soon end later think possible stories well definitely seems yeah sort pretty incredible systems basically arise dynamics perpetuate become complex eventually become conscious build society kind feel like sense kind like deterministic wave kind like happens sufficiently system like earth kind feel like certain sense inevitability really beautiful ends somehow right chemically diverse environment complex dynamical systems evolve become complex certain certain terminating conditions yeah know terminating conditions definitely trend line something part story like go famously described often biological bootloader ais humans mean incredible biological system capable computation love extremely inefficient well like talking audio kind embarrassing honestly manipulating like seven symbols serially using vocal cords happening like multiple seconds like kind embarrassing step frequencies computers operate able cooperate basically seem like synthetic intelligences kind like next stage development know leads like point suspect universe kind puzzle synthetic ais uncover puzzle solve happens right fast forward earth many billions years quiet like turmoil see like city lights stuff like happens end like poof like calming explosion like earth like giant said emit roasters start emitting like giant number satellites yeah kind crazy explosion like stepping explosion like living day day look like actually saw cool animation earth life earth basically nothing happens long time last like two seconds like basically cities everything lower orbit gets cluttered whole thing happens last two seconds like exploding state explosion play yeah yeah play normal speed yeah look like explosion firecracker living firecracker going start emitting kinds interesting things yeah explosion might actually look like little explosion lights fire energy emitted kind stuff look inside details explosion actual complexity happening like yeah human life kind life hope destructive firecracker kind like constructive firecracker right given think hilarious discussion really interesting think like puzzle universe creator universe give us message like example book contact carl sagan message civilization digits expansion pi base eventually kind interesting thought maybe supposed giving message creator maybe supposed somehow create kind quantum mechanical system alerts intelligent presence think perspective say like quantum field theory massive like cellular automaton like thing like even notice exist might even able pick us simulation prove exist intelligent part universe like touring test intelligence earth yeah like creator mean maybe like trying complete next word sentence complicated way like earth basically sending message back yeah puzzle basically like alerting creator exist maybe puzzle break system stick creator way basically like playing video game somehow find exploit find way execute host machine arbitrary code example believe someone got mario game mario play pong exploiting creating basically writing code able execute arbitrary code game maybe maybe puzzle find way exploit think like synthetic ai eventually find universe kind puzzle solve way kind like end game somehow often think simulation universe kind computation might bugs exploits yes yeah think physics essentially think possible physics exploits trying find arranging kind crazy quantum mechanical system somehow gives buffer overflow somehow gives rounding error floating point yeah right like sophisticated exploits jokes could actually close yeah find way extract infinite energy example train reinforcement learning agents physical simulations ask say run quickly flat ground end kinds like weird things part optimization right get back leg slide across floor optimization enforcement learning optimization agent figured way extract infinite energy friction forces basically poor implementation found way generate infinite energy slide across surface expected sort like perverse solution maybe find something like maybe little dog physical simulation cracks escapes intended consequences physics universe came figure kind shortcut weirdness oh man see problem weirdness first person discover weirdness like sliding back legs gon na quickly become everybody thing like paperclip maximizer ridiculous idea well could switch fun well person discover think way think going kind super intelligent agi third generation like building first generation agi know third generation yeah bootloader ai ai bootloader another ai better ai yeah way us introspect like might even think likely things example like say agi likely example completely inert like kinds books sometimes things completely inert interact anything find kind beautiful probably probably figured meta game universe way potentially something completely beyond imagination interact simple chemical life forms like would find kinds ideas compelling source fun source pleasure solving universe inert define means inert escape interaction physical reality behave strange way us beyond playing meta game meta game probably say like arranging quantum mechanical systems weird ways extract infinite energy solve digital expansion pi whatever amount build like little fusion reactors something crazy like something beyond comprehension understandable us actually brilliant hood quantum mechanics system thinking physics really parasites parasite really hurting physics living organisms organism like trying understand really organism deep deep intelligence maybe physics organism super interesting thing like one little thing ant sitting top trying get energy kind like particles wave feel like mostly deterministic takes universe kind big bang kind super intelligent replicator kind stable point universe given laws physics think einstein said god play dice think mostly deterministic randomness thing think deterministic oh tons well gon na careful randomness yeah like random think maybe laws physics deterministic yeah think deterministic got really uncomfortable question anxiety whether universe random sort randomness said like good hunting fault andre fault man like randomness yeah think unsettling think deterministic system think things look random like say collapse wave function et cetera think actually deterministic entanglement kind multiverse theory something something okay feel like free like raised hand chose feel like deterministic thing feels like making choice feels like okay feelings feelings rl agent making choice really making choice choice already yeah interpreting choice creating narrative made yeah talking narrative meta looking back beautiful surprising idea deep learning ai general come across seen field explode grow interesting ways cool ideas like made sit back go hm big small well one thinking recently probably transformer architecture basically neural networks lot architectures trendy come gone different sensory modalities like vision audio text would process different looking neural nets recently seen convergence towards one architecture transformer feed video feed images speech text gobbles kind like bit general purpose computer also trainable efficient run hardware paper came wan na say attention need attention need criticized paper title retrospect foresee bigness impact going yeah sure authors aware impact paper would go probably think aware motivations design decisions behind transformer chose think expand way paper think idea surface like oh translation better architecture translation like really cool differentiable optimizable efficient computer proposed maybe foresight think really interesting funny sorry interrupt title memeable went profound idea went think anyone used kind title right attention need yeah like meme something basically funny one like maybe serious title would impact honestly yeah element honestly agrees prefers way yes ah grand would potentially want meme way greatness tweeted transformer magnificent neural network architecture general purpose differentiable computer simultaneously expressive forward pass optimizable via back propagation gradient descent efficient high parallelism compute graph discuss details expressive optimizable efficient memory general whatever comes heart want general purpose computer train arbitrary problems like say task next work prediction detecting cat image something like want train computer want set weights think number design criteria sort overlap transformer simultaneously made successful think authors kind deliberately trying make really powerful architecture basically powerful forward pass able express general computation sort something looks like message passing nodes store vectors nodes get basically look vectors get communicate basically nodes get broadcast hey looking certain things nodes get broadcast hey things keys values attention yeah exactly transformer much attention component got many pieces architectural went residual connection way arranged perceptron way stacked basically message passing scheme nodes get look decide interesting update think get details think expressive function express lots different types algorithms forward pass way designed residual connections layer normalizations softmax attention everything also optimizable really big deal lots computers powerful ca optimize easy optimize using techniques backpropagation ingredient send first order methods simple optimizers really also need optimizable lastly want run efficiently hardware hardware massive throughput machine like gpus prefer lots parallelism want lots sequential operations want lot operations serially transformer designed mind well designed hardware designed expressive forward pass also optimizable backward pass said residual connections support kind ability learn short algorithms fast first gradually extend longer training idea learning short algorithms right think basically transformer series blocks blocks attention little multilayered perception go block come back residual pathway go come back number layers arranged sequentially way look think residual pathway backward pass gradients sort flow along uninterrupted addition distributes gradient equally branches gradient supervision top floats directly first layer residual connections arranged beginning initialization contribute nothing residual pathway kind looks like imagine transformer kind like python function like dev get various kinds lines code say layers deep transformer typically would much shorter say lines code something think optimization basically looks like first optimize first line code second line code kick third line code kick kind feel like residual pathway dynamics optimization sort learn short algorithm gets approximate answer layers sort kick start create contribution end optimizing algorithm lines code except lines code complex entire block transformer lot really interesting transformer actually remarkably resilient basically transformer came transformer would use today except reshuffle layer norms layer normalizations reshuffled formulation remarkably stable lot bells whistles people attached tried improve think basically big step simultaneously optimizing lots properties desirable neural network architecture think people trying change proven remarkably resilient think even better architectures potentially admire resilience something profound architecture least resilient maybe everything turned problem transformers solve currently definitely looks like transformer taking ai feed basically arbitrary problems general differentiable computer extremely powerful convergence ai really interesting watch personally else think could discovered transformers like surprising thing stable want stable place something interesting might discover transformers like aha moments maybe memory maybe knowledge representation kind stuff definitely zeitgeist today pushing like basically right zeitgeist touch transformer touch everything else people scaling datasets making much much bigger working evaluation making evaluation much much bigger basically keeping architecture unchanged last five years progress ai kind think one flavor language models surprised sort imagination captivated mentioned dpt bigger bigger bigger language models limits models think task natural language basically way gpt trained right download massive amount text data internet try predict next word sequence roughly speaking predicting little word chunks roughly speaking really interesting watch basically language model language models actually existed long time papers language modeling even earlier explain case language model yeah language model basically rough idea predicting next word sequence roughly speaking paper example ben geo team first time using neural network take say like three five words predict next word much smaller data sets neural net transformer perceptron first time neural network applied setting even neural networks language models except using ngram models ngram models models start take two words predict third one count many times seen two word combinations came next predict coming next seen training set language modeling around long time neural networks done language modeling long time really new interesting exciting realizing scale powerful enough neural net transformer emergent properties basically happens large enough data set text task predicting next word multitasking huge amount different kinds problems multitasking understanding chemistry physics human nature lots things sort clustered objective simple objective actually understand lot world make prediction said u word understanding terms chemistry physics feel like searching right context actual process happening yeah basically gets thousand words trying predict thousand first order well entire data set available internet actually basically kind understand context going sufficiently hard problem powerful enough computer like transformer end interesting solutions ask kinds things shows lot emergent properties like context learning big deal gpt original paper published sort prompt various ways ask various things kind complete sentence process completing sentence actually solving kinds really interesting problems care think something like understanding like use word understanding us humans think understanding way understands think lot world order predict next word sequence trained data internet think approach terms data sets using data internet think internet enough structured data teach ai human civilization yeah think internet huge amount data sure complete enough set know text enough sufficiently powerful agi outcome course audio video images kind stuff yeah text little bit suspicious ton things put text writing obvious us world works physics things fall put stuff text would share understanding text communication medium humans encompassing medium knowledge world pointed video images audio think definitely helps lot trained models sufficiently across across modalities yet think lot people interested wonder shared understanding like might call common sense learned inferred order complete sentence correctly maybe fact implied internet model gon na learn reading inferring representation like common sense like think learn common sense like nobody says tells us explicitly figure interacting world model reading way people interact world might infer wonder yeah briefly worked project called world bits training rl system take actions internet versus consuming internet like talked think future kind system interacting internet help learning yes think probably final frontier lot models mentioned openai working project world bits basically idea giving neural networks access keyboard mouse idea could possibly go wrong basically perceive input screen pixels basically state computer sort visualized human consumption images web browser stuff like give neural network ability press keyboards use mouse trying get example complete bookings interact user interfaces learn experience fun stuff super cool idea yeah mean like yeah mean step observer actor super fascinating step yeah well universal interface digital realm would say universal interface physical realm mind humanoid form factor kind thing later talk optimists feel like kind like similar philosophy way human physical world designed human form digital world designed human form seeing screen using keyboard mouse universal interface basically command digital infrastructure built feels like powerful interface command build top question like learned interesting world bits basically early think openai time around zeitgeist time different ai zeitgeist today time everyone super excited reinforcement learning scratch time atari paper neural networks playing atari games beating humans cases alphago everyone excited training neural networks scratch using reinforcement learning directly turns reinforcement learning extremely inefficient way training neural networks taking actions observations get sparse rewards stuff based inputs like told good thing bad thing extremely hard problem ca learn burn forest sort boot force saw think go dota work extremely inefficient want approach problems practically speaking approach time also took world bits would agent initialize randomly keyboard mash mouse mash tried make booking like revealed insanity approach quickly stumble correct booking order get reward correctly never gon na stumble chance random even simple web interface many options many options sparse reward signal starting scratch time know read understand pictures images buttons understand means like make booking happened time revisit openai interested companies like adept interested idea coming back interface powerful training agent scratch taking gpt initialization gpt text understands booking understands submit understands quite bit already representations powerful makes training significantly efficient makes problem tractable interaction like way humans see buttons language html javascript css think better today interaction mostly level html css done computational constraints think ultimately everything designed human visual consumption end day additional information layout webpage next red background kind stuff looks like visually think final frontier taking pixels giving keyboard mouse commands think impractical still today worry bots internet given ideas given exciting worry bots twitter stupid bots see crypto bots bots might actually see interacting interesting ways kind system feels like able pass robot click button whatever actually understand test works quite like checkbox whatever click presumably tracking oh see like mouse movement timing exactly kind system talking able pass yeah feel bots language models plus interactability able tweet reply worry world yeah think always bit arms race sort attack defense attack get stronger defense get stronger well ability detect defend detect know carpati account twitter human would approach like people claimed know would defend court law human account human yeah point think might think society evolve little bit like might start signing digitally signing correspondence things create right necessary maybe future might think going towards world share digital space ais synthetic beings yeah get much better share digital realm eventually share physical realm well much harder kind like world going towards benign awful malicious going arms race trying detect mean worst ais worst ais pretending human know always malicious obviously lot malicious applications could also know ai would try hard pretend human human world would get respect ai want get love respect twitter think problem intractable people thinking proof personhood might start digitally signing stuff might end like yeah basically solution proof personhood seem intractable something think need really starts emerge soon think people think much race obviously probably spoof fake proof personhood try figure probably mean weird like social security numbers like passports stuff seems like harder fake stuff physical space digital space feels like going tricky tricky seems pretty low cost fake stuff going put ai jail like trying use fake personhood proof mean okay fine put lot ais jail ais like exponentially cost creating bot low unless kind way track accurately like allowed create program without showing tying program like program runs internet able trace every single human program involved program yeah maybe start declaring know start drawing boundaries keeping track okay digital entities versus human entities ownership human entities digital entities something like know think optimistic possible sense currently like worst time bots suddenly become capable defenses yet built society think seem intractable something deal seems weird twitter bot like really crappy twitter bots numerous like presume engineers twitter good seems like would infer seems like hard problem probably catching right sort steal man case hard problem huge cost false positive removing post somebody bot creates bad user experience cautious removing maybe maybe bots really good learning gets removed stay ahead removal process quickly impression honestly lot loaning mean subtle impression subtle yeah impression well feels like maybe seeing tip iceberg maybe number bots like trillions like constant assault bots know steal man case bots seeing pretty obvious could write lines code catch bots mean definitely lot loaning say agree sophisticated actor could probably create pretty good bot right using tools like gpts language model generate faces look quite good scale think yeah quite plausible going hard defend google engineer claimed lambda sentient think inkling truth felt importantly least think language models achieve sentience illusion sentience soonish yeah little bit canary coal mine kind moment honestly little bit engineer spoke like chat bot google became convinced bot sentient asked existential philosophical questions gave like reasonable answers looked real sufficiently trying stress system think exposing truth today think increasingly harder time yeah think people basically become yeah think people like time gets better like form emotional connection ai chat bot yeah perfectly plausible mind think ais actually quite good human connection human emotion ton text internet humans connection love think good understanding sense people speak capable creating lot kind text lot imagined ais different way calculating cold machines getting today getting pretty emotional ais actually competent capable generating plausible sounding text respect topics see really hopeful ai systems like companions help grow develop human help maximize happiness also worried ai systems figure internet humans get attracted drama would like ais constantly hear gossip try plant seeds suspicion humans love trust kind mess people going get lot attention drama maximize drama path maximizing engagement us humans feed machine giant drama shitstorm worried objective function really defines way human civilization progresses ais yeah think right least today sort correct really think agents want something memory anything literally good approximation get words trying predict first continue feeding free prompt whatever way want text say ok psychologist good love humans conversation another human human colon something something continues pattern suddenly conversation fake psychologist trying help still kind like realm tool people prompt arbitrary ways create really incredible text goals long periods time try look way right yeah goals effects prompting goal get andrei kapazidze respond twitter like think ai might goal might figure talking shit would best highly sophisticated interesting way build relationship respond like time gets sophisticated like talk shit okay maybe wo get andrei might get another celebrity might get big accounts simple goal get respond maximize probability actual response yeah mean could prompt powerful model like opinion possible thing interested kind track become oracles sort think way oracles currently text calculators access google search kinds gadgets gizmos able operate internet find different information yeah sense kind like currently looks like terms development think improvement eventually google access human knowledge like effective search engine access human knowledge think definite scope building better search engine today think google tools people everything need puzzle pieces people training transformers scale data obvious capable organization innovate search engine right someone else absolute scope building significantly better search engine built tools interesting large company search already infrastructure works brings lot money structurally inside company motivation pivot say going build new search engine yeah really hard usually going come startup right would yeah competent organization know currently example maybe bing another shot know example microsoft edge talking offline mean definitely really interesting search engines used okay query web pages look like stuff could directly go answer supporting evidence models basically read texts read web pages sometimes see going search results sort getting like sense like average answer whatever interested like directly comes work kind like yeah think way distilling knowledge like level insight basically think prompting kind teaching learning like whole process like another layer know cause maybe humans background model world prompting yeah exactly think way programming computers like gpts converging program humans mean program humans via prompt go people prompt things prompt information natural language prompt program humans starting program computers directly interface like pretty remarkable honestly spoken lot idea software good ideas become like cliches quickly like terms kind hilarious like think eminem said like gets annoyed song written quickly means gon na big hit cause catchy describe idea thinking evolved months years since coined yeah yeah blog post software think several years ago reason wrote post kept kind saw something remarkable happening like software development lot code transitioned written sort like written weights neural net basically saying neural nets taking software realm software taking tasks time think many people understood deeply enough big deal big transition neural networks seen one multiple classification algorithms might use dataset problem kaggle like change program computers saw neural nets going take way program computers going change going people writing software something like directly programming software going accumulating training sets data sets crafting objectives train neural nets point going compilation process data sets objective architecture specification binary really neural net weights forward pass neural net deploy binary talking sort transition post saw sort play lot fields autopilot one also simple image classification people thought originally would write algorithm detecting dog image ideas brain first detect corners detect lines stitched really going thinking going write algorithm way build smooth transition okay first thought going build everything building features like hog features things like detect little statistical patterns image patches little bit learning top like support vector machine binary classifier cat versus dog images top features wrote features trained last layer sort classifier people like actually let even design features ca honestly good let also learn features end basically convolutional neural net learning specifying architecture architecture tons filling blanks knobs let optimization write transition happening across industry everywhere suddenly end ton code written neural net weights pointing analogy actually pretty strong lot developer environments software like ides work code debug code run code maintain code github trying make analogies new realm like github software turns something looks like hugging face right think people took seriously built cool companies many people originally attacked post actually well received wrote think maybe something title post well received think people sort coming around time yeah director ai tesla think idea really implemented scale engineering teams software sort linger idea think really early stages everything said like github ides like build engineering teams work software systems data collection data annotation part software like think task programming software debugging space hyperparameters also debugging space data yeah way program computer influence algorithm writing commands changing mostly data set changing loss functions neural net trying trying predict things basically data sets architecture neural net case autopilot lot data sets example detection objects lane line markings traffic lights accumulate massive data sets example desired label roughly algorithm look like convolutional neural net specification architecture like hint algorithm roughly look like fill blanks process optimization training process take neural net trained gives right answers data set deploy case perhaps machine learning cases lot tasks coming formulating task like neural network formulating task part programming yeah harry marceau break problem set tasks yeah high level would say look software running autopilot gave number talks topic would say originally lot written software imagine lots right gradually tiny neural net example predicting given single image like traffic light lane line marking neural net much scope software making tiny predictions individual little image rest system stitched okay actually single camera eight cameras actually eight cameras time predictions put together fusion information act written humans decided okay actually want fusion code actually good enough write algorithm want neural nets write algorithm want port software stack actually neural nets take eight camera images simultaneously make predictions actually make predictions space images make predictions directly actually three dimensions around car actually manually fuse predictions time trust write tracker actually give neural net information time takes videos makes predictions sort like putting power neural net processing end eventual sort goal software potentially land works significantly better humans good writing software basically prediction happening like land three dimensional world time annotation world data annotation whether self supervised manual humans big part software world right would say far industry like talking industry technology available everything supervised learning need data sets input desired output need lots three properties need need large need accurate mistakes need diverse want lot correct examples one thing need really cover space possibility much cover space possible inputs better algorithm work end really good data sets collecting curating cleaning train neural net top lot work goes cleaning data sets pointed probably could question achieve ton want basically predict need data back video eight videos coming cameras system saw truth actually around car car car lane line markings geometry road traffic light three dimensional position need ground truth big question team solving course arrive ground truth million large clean diverse training neural net works extremely well ship car many mechanisms collected training data always go human annotation go simulation source ground truth also go call offline tracker spoken ai day basically automatic reconstruction process taking videos recovering three dimensional sort reality around car basically think like three dimensional reconstruction offline thing understanding ok seconds video saw therefore lane lines cars annotation train neural nets imitate difficult reconstruction difficult done overlap cameras reconstruction perhaps inaccuracy caught annotation step yes nice thing annotation fully offline infinite time chunk one minute trying offline supercomputer somewhere figure positions cars people full one minute video angles run neural nets want efficient massive neural nets neural nets ca even run car later test time even powerful neural nets eventually deploy anything want three dimensional reconstruction neural nets anything want recover truth supervise truth learned said mistakes humans annotation assume humans like range things good terms clicking stuff screen interesting problem designing annotator humans accurate enjoy like even metrics efficient productive kind stuff yeah grew annotation team tesla basically zero really interesting background phd student researcher growing kind organization pretty crazy yeah think extremely interesting part design process much behind autopilot use humans humans good certain kinds annotations good example two dimensional annotations images good annotating cars time three dimensional space hard careful design tasks easy humans versus things left offline tracker like maybe computer triangulation reconstruction human say exactly pixels image car exactly pixels human data annotation pipeline much bread butter daily think still lot open problems space general annotation stuff machines good machines humans good maybe iterative process think large extent went number iterations learned ton create data sets seeing big open problems like originally joined really sure would turn time left much secure actually sort understand philosophy create data sets pretty comfortable time strengths limitations cameras driving task understanding formulate driving task vision task eight cameras seen entire history computer vision field neural networks step back strengths limitations pixels using pixels drive yeah pixels think beautiful sensory beautiful sensor would say thing like cameras cheap provide ton information ton bits extremely cheap sensor ton bits one bits constraint state world get lots megapixel images cheap gives constraints understanding actually world vision probably highest bandwidth sensor high bandwidth sensor love pixels constraint world highly complex high bandwidth constraint state world fascinating real importance sensor humans use therefore everything designed sensor yeah text writing flashing signs everything designed vision find everywhere interface want talking universal interfaces actually want measure world well develop software sensor constraints state world humans use understand world mean vision ultimately main one referencing understanding human behavior common sense physics could inferred vision perception perspective feels like using kind reasoning predict world pixels mean powerful prior world evolves time et cetera likelihood term coming data telling observing also prior term likely things see likely move question complex range possibilities might happen driving task still open problem difficult driving philosophically speaking time worked driving understand hard driving yeah driving really hard predictions agents theory mind going looking looking thinking yeah lot goes full tail expansion nines comfortable eventually final problems form think problems common think eventually important really tail end tail end rare edge cases vision perspective toughest parts vision problem driving well basically sensor extremely powerful still need process information going brightnesses pixel values hey three dimensional world extremely hard neural networks fundamentally difficulty really extremely good job engineering entire pipeline entire data engine capacity train neural nets ability evaluate system iterate would say production scale like hard part execution problem data engine also deployment system low latency performance steps yeah neural net specifically making sure everything fits chip car finite budget flops perform memory bandwidth constraints make sure flies squeeze much computer tiny learned process maybe one bigger new things coming research background system run heavily constrained resources run really fast kind insights learned yeah sure many insights trying create neural net fit available always trying optimize talked lot ai day basically triple backflips team make sure fits utilizes engine think extremely good engineering kinds little insights peppered properly let actually zoom think talked data engine entirety layouts idea think beautiful humans loop describe data engine yeah data engine call almost biological feeling process perfect training sets neural networks programming level data sets make sure large diverse clean basically data set think good train neural net deploy observe well performing trying always increase quality data set trying catch scenarios basically rare scenarios neural nets typically struggle told rare cases data set close loop collect scale feed back reconstruction process described reconstruct truth cases add data set whole thing ends like staircase improvement perfecting training set go deployments mine parts yet represented well data set data set basically imperfect needs diverse pockets missing need pad pockets sort think way data role humans play biological system like human body made cells role like optimize human system multiple engineers collaborating figuring focus contribute task optimize neural network charge figuring task needs data speak hyperparameters human system really comes extremely good execution engineering team knows understand intuitively philosophical insights underlying data engine process system improves delegate strategy data collection works making sure extremely well executed work even philosophizing research ideas extremely good execution hard dealing data scale role data engine executing well difficult extremely important priority like vision board saying really need get better stoplights yeah like prioritization tasks essentially comes data comes large extent trying achieve product map trying release trying get feedback qa team system struggling things trying improve qa team gives signal information aggregate performance system various conditions right course us drive also see really nice work system also experience know drives home insight draw individual experience ca quite get aggregate statistical analysis data yeah weird right yes scientific sense one anecdotal sample yeah think ton source truth interaction system yeah see play perturb get sense intuition think numbers like way numbers plots graphs much harder hides lot like train language model really powerful way interacting yeah try build intuition yeah think like ilan also always wanted drive system drives lot wan na say almost daily also sees source truth driving system performing yeah think tough questions tesla last year removed radar sensor suite announced gon na remove ultrasonic sensors relying solely vision camera make perception problem harder easier would almost reframe question way thing basically would think additional sensors way interrupt go ahead wonder language model ever prompt let reframe question would epic wrong prompt sorry like little bit wrong question basically would think sensors asset fully consider entire product entirety sensors actually potentially liability sensors free appear car need suddenly need entire supply chain people procuring problems may need replacement part manufacturing process hold back line production need source need maintain teams write firmware also incorporate fuse system way actually like bloats lot think elon really good simplify simplify best part part always tries throw away things essential understands entropy organizations approach think case cost high potentially seeing computer vision engineer trying improve network useful less useful useful thing consider full cost sensor actually potentially liability need really sure giving extremely useful information case looked using using delta massive useful also bloat data engine like sensors distraction sensors change time example one type say radar type radar change time suddenly need worry suddenly column sqlite telling oh sensor type different distributions contribute noise entropy everything bloat stuff also organizationally really fascinating distracting wan na get work vision resources building data engine actually making forward progress sensor bandwidth constraints world investing fully make extremely good finite amount sort spend focus across different facets system kind reminds rich sutton bitter lesson seems like simplifying system long run course know long run seems always right solution yeah yes case rl seems apply generally across systems computation think lidar crutch debate battle point clouds pixels yeah think debate always slightly confusing seems like actual debate fleet really important thing whether achieve really good functioning ai system scale data collection systems yeah fleet significantly important whether lidar another sensor yeah think similar radar discussion basically think basically offer extra information extremely costly kinds problems worry calibrate et cetera creates bloat entropy really sure need sensor case basically think need think honestly make stronger statement think others companies using probably going drop yeah consider sensor full considering build big fleet collects lot data integrate sensor data sensor data engine able quickly find different parts data continuously improves whatever model using yeah another way look like vision necessary sense world designed human visual consumption need vision necessary also sufficient information need driving humans obviously vision drive necessary sufficient want focus resources really sure going bring sensors could add sensors infinity point need draw line think case really consider full cost one sensor adopting really need think answer case think idea companies forming high resolution maps constraining heavily geographic regions operate approach view going scale time entirety united states think mentioned environments need refresh map perfect centimeter level accuracy map everywhere going drive crazy going talking autonomy actually changing world talking deployment global scale autonomous systems transportation need maintain centimeter accurate map earth like many cities keep updated huge dependency taking huge dependency massive massive dependency need ask really need humans need useful low level map like okay connectivity road know fork coming drive environment sort high level understanding like small google map tesla uses google map like similar kind resolution information system environments send level accuracy crutch distraction costs entropy diffuses team dilutes team focusing actually necessary computer vision problem learn machine learning engineering life one human working elon musk think learned sort run organizations efficiently create efficient organizations fight entropy organization human engineering fight entropy yeah think elon efficient warrior fight entropy organizations entropy organization look like exactly process process inefficiencies form meetings kind stuff yeah meetings hates meetings keeps telling people skip meetings useful basically runs world biggest startups would say tesla spacex world biggest startups tesla actually multiple startups think better look way think extremely good yeah good intuition streamlining processes making everything efficient best part part simplifying focusing kind removing barriers moving quickly making big moves startupy sort seeming things scale strong drive simplify perspective mean also probably applies designing systems machine learning otherwise like simplify simplify yes think secret maintaining startup culture company grows introspect think need someone powerful position big hammer like elon like cheerleader idea ruthlessly pursues one big enough hammer everything turns committees democracy within company process talking stakeholders everything crumbles big person also really smart big hammer things move quickly said favorite scene interstellar intense docking scene ai cooper talking saying cooper docking possible necessary good line way many questions ai scene presumably supposed able compute lot human saying optimal human mean movie ai know much better human anyway think value setting seemingly impossible goals like initial intuition seems like something taken elon espouses initial intuition community might say difficult take anyway crazy deadline human engineering perspective seen value would say setting impossible goals exactly good idea think setting ambitious goals good idea think call scaling difficulty means x problems x hard usually x harder problem like two three x harder execute wan na actually wan na improve system costs amount work wan na x improve system cost x amount work fundamentally change approach start constraint approaches obviously dumb going work forces reevaluate think interesting way approaching problem solving requires weird kind thinking going back phd days like think ideas machine learning community solvable yes requires mean cliche first principles thinking requires basically ignore community saying community science usually draw lines possible right hard break without going crazy yeah mean think good example deep learning revolution sense could computer vision time deep learning revolution could improving computer vision stack saying actually useless x better computer vision well probably tuning hog feature detector need different approach need something scalable going back richard sutton understanding sort like philosophy bitter lesson like actually need much scalable system like neural network principle works deep believers actually execute mission make work x solution yeah think timeline solve problem autonomous driving still part open question yeah think tough thing timelines obviously one created yeah like think timeline build bridge well built million bridges long takes one built autonomy obvious parts turn much easier others really hard forecast best based trend lines based intuition fundamentally really hard forecast one built even still inside hard yes things turn much harder things turn much easier try avoid making forecasts elon avoid right heads car companies past avoided either ford places made predictions gon na solve level four driving whatever kind backtracking prediction ai person privately make predictions get way actual ability think thing yeah would say easy say problem tractable easy prediction make tractable going work yes really hard things turn harder things turn easier definitely feels tractable feels like least team tesla saw internally definitely track form strong representation allows make prediction tractability like leader lot humans kind say actually possible like build intuition even driving could tasks could difficult task work life mean classification achieving certain image net certain level superhuman level performance yeah expert intuition intuition belief like thinking long enough like studying looking sample data like said driving intuition really flawed like good intuition tractability could anything could solvable like know driving task could simplified something quite trivial like solution problem would quite trivial scale cars driving perfectly might make problem much easier yeah cars driving like people learn drive correctly correctly way optimal heterogeneous system autonomous manually driven cars could change stuff also spent ridiculous number hours staring pedestrians crossing streets thinking humans feels like way use eye contact sends really strong signals certain quirks edge cases behavior course lot fatalities happen drunk driving pedestrian side driver side problem driving night kind yeah wonder know like space possible solutions autonomous driving includes many human factor issues almost impossible predict could super clean nice solutions yeah would say definitely like use game analogy fog war definitely also see frontier improvement measure historically much made progress think example least seen roughly five years tesla joined barely kept lane highway think going palo alto sf like three four interventions anytime road would anything geometrically turn much would like work going like pretty competent system five years seeing happens also hood scale team operating respect data compute everything else massive progress climbing mountain fog making lot progress fog making progress see next directions looking remaining challenges perturbing changing philosophy contorting like actually things still need yeah fundamental components solving problem seem data engine compute compute car compute training kind stuff done years tesla done lot amazing breakthrough ideas engineering data engine human side speak chose leave tesla basically described ren think time five years kind gotten little bit managerial position days meetings growing organization making decisions sort high level strategic decisions team working kind like corporate executive role think okay fundamentally enjoy think joined computer vision team tesla going transition using mobileye third party vendor computer vision build computer vision system showed two people training deep neural networks training computer legs like yeah workstation kind basic classification task yeah kind like grew think fairly respectable deep learning team massive compute cluster good data annotation organization happy became quite autonomous kind stepped away know excited much technical things yeah kind like focus agi soul searching like cause took little time think like many mushrooms take kidding mean going mind human lifetime finite yeah incredible things one best teachers ai world one best mean mean best possible way one best tinkerers ai world meaning like understanding fundamentals something works building scratch playing basic intuitions like einstein feynman really good kind stuff like small example thing play try understand obviously tessa helped build team machine learning like engineers assistant actually accomplishes something real world given like soul searching like well hard obviously love company lot love elon love tesla want hard leave love team basically yeah think actually potentially like interested revisiting maybe coming back point working optimus working agi tesla think tesla going incredible things basically like massive large scale robotics kind company ton talent really incredible things think human robots going amazing think autonomous transportation going amazing happening tesla think really amazing organization part helping along think basically enjoyed lot yeah basically difficult reasons love company happy potentially point come back act felt like stage built team felt autonomous became manager wanted lot technical stuff wanted learn stuff wanted teach stuff kind felt like good time change pace little bit think best movie sequel time speaking part two suck movie sequels movie sequels yeah tweet movies tiny tangent like favorite movie sequel godfather part two fan godfather even tweet mention godfather yeah love movie know reach gon na edit gon na edit hate towards godfather dare disrespect think make strong statement know oh know basically like movie something like mention terminator okay okay like terminator little bit later think terminator like terminator well okay like exceptions large reason like movies something feel slow camera like zoomed boring kind naive kind weird also terminator much ahead time yes godfather like agi mean good hunting one movies mentioned agi either guess mathematics yeah guess occasionally enjoy movies feature like anchorman anchorman good understand speaking agi understand ferrell funny make sense compute something singular human get many comedies days wonder culture machine hollywood got lucky certain people comedy came together singular human ridiculous tangent apologize mentioned humanoid robots think optimus tesla bot think robots factory home years yeah think hard project think going take else going build human robots scale think good form factor go like mentioned world designed humanoid form factor things would able operate machines would able sit chairs potentially even drive cars basically world designed humans form factor want invest make work time think another school thought okay pick problem design robot actually designing robot getting whole data engine everything behind work actually incredibly hard problem makes sense go general interfaces okay perfect one given task actually generality prompt english able something across think makes lot sense go general interface physical world think difficult project think going take time see company execute vision think going amazing like basically physical labor like think transportation large market try physical labor like insane physical labor thing also exciting social robotics relationship different levels robots really excited see optimus like people criticized excitement worked lot research labs robots boston dynamics unitry lot companies legged robots elegance movement tiny tiny part big picture integrating two big exciting things tesla humanoid legged robots clearly integrating data engine data engine aspect actual intelligence perception control planning kind stuff integrating fleet mentioned speaking fleet second thing mass manufacturers knowing culturally driving towards simple robot cheap produce scale well experience well changes everything different culture style boston dynamics way robots way move long time tesla achieve smoothness movement entirety system like talked data engine fleet super exciting even initial sort models really surprising months get prototype yep reason happened quickly alluded ton copy paste happening autopilot lot amount expertise came woodworks tesla building human robot incredible see basically elon said one point next day basically cad models started appear people talk supply chain manufacturing people showed screwdrivers everything day started put together body like whoa people exist tesla fundamentally building car actually different building robot true hardware pieces also let forget hardware demo manufacturing hardware scale whole different thing software well basically robot currently thinks car going midlife crisis point thinks car earlier demos actually talking potentially outside parking lot computer vision working box instead inside operating system everything computer vision mostly mean retrain neural nets approach everything data engine offline trackers way go occupancy tracker everything need retrain neural nets planning control course change quite bit ton happening tesla go goal ok let build million human robots tesla lot ask tesla actually like crazy question difficult like driving difficult manipulation task impact scale think depending context really nice thing robotics unless manufacturer kind stuff room error driving safety critical also time critical robot allowed move slower nice yes think going take long time way want structure development need say ok going take long time set product development roadmap making revenue along way setting loss function work works want position want make useful almost immediately want slowly deploy generalize scale want set data engine improvement loops telemetry evaluation harness everything want improve product time incrementally making revenue along way extremely important otherwise build large undertakings make sense economically also point view team working need dopamine along way going make promise useful going change world years works want want place like think autopilot today offering increased safety convenience driving today people pay people like people purchase also greater mission working towards see dopamine team source happiness satisfaction deploying people like people drive people pay care youtube videos grandma drives gives feedback people like people engage engage huge people drive teslas recognize give love like hey thanks nice feature yeah think tricky thing people really love people unfortunately working something think extremely valuable useful et cetera people hate lot people hate team whole project think tesla drivers many cases actually yeah actually makes sad humans current ways humans interact think actually fixable think humans want good think twitter social media part mechanism actually somehow makes negativity viral deserve disproportionately add viral boost negativity wish people would get excited suppress jealousy ego get excited others karma aspect get excited others get excited thing academia careful dynamical system think silos get jealous somebody else successful actually perhaps counterintuitively leads less productivity community individually feel like keep celebrating others actually makes successful think people depending industry quite learned yet people also negative vocal prominently featured actually ton people cheerleaders silent cheerleaders talk people world tell oh amazing great especially people understand difficult get stuff working people built products makers entrepreneurs making work changing something incredibly hard people likely cheerlead well one things makes sad folks robotics community cheerleading know difficult well actually sometimes know difficult create product scale actually deploy real world lot development robots ai systems done specific small benchmarks opposed real world conditions yes yeah think really hard work robotics academic setting ai systems apply real world criticized flourished loved time imagenet famed imagenet data set recently words criticism academic research ml community gives little much love still imagenet like kinds benchmarks speak strengths weaknesses data sets used machine learning research actually know recall specific instance unhappy criticizing imagenet think imagenet extremely valuable basically benchmark allowed deep learning community demonstrate deep neural networks actually work massive value think imagenet useful basically become bit mnist point mnist like little grayscale digits kind joke data set everyone crushes still papers written mnist though right maybe strong papers like papers focus learn small amount data yeah could see helpful sort mainline computer vision research anymore course think way heard somewhere maybe imagining things think said imagenet huge contribution community long time time move past kinds well imagenet crushed error rates yeah getting accuracy classification way prediction seen images really high really good remember correctly top five error rate like something given experience gigantic real world data set would like see benchmarks move certain directions research community uses unfortunately think academics currently next imagenet think crushed mnist basically kind crushed imagenet next big benchmark entire community rallies behind uses development networks yeah would takes data set captivate imagination everybody like get behind could also need like leader right somebody popularity mean yeah imagenet take accident history right amount difficult right amount difficult simple interesting enough kind like right time kind data set question reddit thoughts role synthetic data game engines play future neural net model development think neural nets converge humans value simulation neural nets similar value simulation humans people use simulation learn something kind system without actually experience referring simulation head sorry simulation mean like video games forms simulation various professionals let push back maybe simulation heads like simulate think happen ok like internal simulation yeah internal assuming act oh yeah independent use simulation sense like computer games using simulation training set creation something independent loosely correlated useful like counterfactual like edge case simulation like happens nuclear war happens kinds things yeah different simulation unreal engine interpreted question like simulation average case unreal engine mean unreal engine simulating world physics world different like also add behavior world could try kinds stuff right could throw kinds weird things unreal engine simulating mean guess simulating physics world also something yeah graphics physics agents put environment stuff like see feel like said important guess future ai development correct interpret way think humans use simulators humans use simulators find useful computers use simulators find useful ok saying use simulators often play video game every think derive wisdom existence video games momentary escape reality versus source wisdom reality think polite way saying simulation useful yeah maybe see fundamental really important part training neural nets currently think neural nets become powerful think need fewer examples train additional behaviors simulation course domain gap simulation real world slightly something different powerful enough neural net domain gap bigger think neural net understand even though real world high level structure supposed able learn neural net actually able leverage synthetic data better closing gap understanding ways real data exactly right better questions next time question kidding right possible think speaking mnist construct neural nets training processes require little data talking huge data sets like internet training mean one way say like said querying another level training guess requires little data see value research going direction use little data train construct knowledge base think point need massive data set massive neural net get something like gpt something able efficient training arbitrary new task lot gpts tasks like sentiment analysis translation prompted examples kind thing want like input sentence translation german input sentence translation german input sentence blank neural net complete translation german looking example provided example learning activations neural net instead weights neural net think basically like humans neural nets become learning new task point need massive data set network get probably humans something like something like passive background background model constructing thing runs time way conscious think humans definitely mean obviously learn lot lifespan also ton hardware helps us initialization coming evolution think also really big component lot people field think talk amounts seconds person lived pretending wlrrsa sort like zero initialization neural net like look lot animals like example zebras zebras get born see run zero train data lifespan somehow idea evolutionists found way encode algorithms neural net initializations extremely good atcgs idea works apparently possible proof existence something magical going single cell organism born first years life kind like idea reason remember anything first years life really painful process like difficult challenging training process like intellectually maybe yeah mean remember might crazy training going maybe background model training painful best system trained remember constructed think like hardware memory fully developed kind feel like first years infants actually learning brain maturing born premature theory along lines birth canal swallowing brain born premature first years brain maturing learning eventually current view think neural nets memory approaches something like humans think need another meta architecture top add something like knowledge base learns facts world kind stuff yes know extent explicitly constructed might take unintuitive forms telling gpt like hey declarative memory bank store retrieve data whenever encounter information find useful save memory bank example something retrieved say load say load whatever teach text english might learn use memory bank oh neural net architecture background model base thing everything else top pretty easy use text right giving gadgets gizmos teaching kind special language save arbitrary information retrieve later time telling special tokens arrange use interfaces like hey use calculator use plus equals equals calculator actually read answer calculate tell english might actually work think sense gato interesting deepmind system language actually throws pile images actions kind stuff basically moving towards yeah think gato much kitchen sink approach reinforcement learning lots different environments single fixed transformer model right think early result realm think yeah along lines think things eventually look like right early days system eventually look like rich sudden perspective yeah super huge fan think interfaces look different would want everything normalized api example screen pixels api instead different world environments different physics joint configurations appearances whatever kind special tokens different games plug rather normalize everything single interface looks neural net makes sense going pong end think let ask personal life lot people want know one productive brilliant people history ai productive day life andrej kapati look like time wake imagine kind dance average productive day perfect productive day perfect productive day thing strive towards average converges given mistakes human eventualities time wake morning person morning person night owl sure stable like eight nine something like phd even later used go sleep usually think hours precious interesting time work everyone asleep east coast awake already activity already text messages whatever stuff happening go news website stuff happening distracting everything totally quiet going bothered solid chunks time work like periods night owl default think productive time basically like need build momentum problem without much distraction need load ram working memory problem need obsessed taking shower falling asleep need obsessed problem fully memory ready wake work right temporal scale single day couple days week month ca talk one day basically isolation whole process want get productive problem feel like need span days really get problem want interrupted going completely obsessed problem good workouts done bunch cool little projects short amount time quickly requires focusing yeah basically need load working memory problem need productive always huge fixed cost approaching problem struggling example tesla want work small side project ok first need figure ok need ssh cluster need bring vs code editor work ran stupid error reason point productive right away facing barriers really removing barrier able go problem full problem loaded memory somehow avoiding distractions different forms like news stories emails also distractions interesting projects previously worked currently working want really focus mind mean take time distractions think ca much day spent problem drink coffee morning routine look news twitter hacker news wall street journal et cetera great basically wake coffee trying get work quickly possible take diet hell happening world first find interesting know world know useful good part routine right read bunch news articles want informed suspicious suspicious practice currently oh mean suspicious positive effect practice productivity psychologically yeah also ability deeply understand world bunch sources information really focused deeply integrating yeah little distracting terms perfectly productive day long stretch time one session try work focus thing couple hours one hour minutes minutes probably go small hours need breaks food stuff think still really hard accumulate hours using tracker told exactly much time spent coding one day even productive day still spent six eight hours much padding commute talking people food et cetera cost life living sustaining homeostasis maintaining human high seems desire within human mind participate society creates padding productive days ever completely start finish tuning everything sitting could six eight hours wisdom gives strength tough days long focus yeah whenever get obsessed problem something needs work something needs exist needs exist able deal bugs programming issues technical issues design decisions turn wrong ones able think given want think exist yeah needs exist think also big factor humans going appreciate going like big part motivation helping humans seem happy say nice things tweet whatever gives pleasure something useful see sharing world like whether github blog post videos yeah thinking suppose things share think would amount motivation build enjoy feeling people gaining value happiness stuff created diet saw played intermittent fasting fast help played everything played things played beneficial ability mentally focus thing mental productivity happiness still fast yeah still fast intermittent fasting really means end day skip breakfast roughly default steady state traveling something else break rules steady state eat six hard rule break often default yeah done bunch random experiments part right last year half wan na say heard sounds better mean exactly actually know difference sounds better mind means prefer food raw cooked prefer cooked forgive actually know wide category plant entails means militant flex prefer eat plants trying influence people come someone house party serve steak really proud eat yes right judging oh beautiful mean flip side sort flexible tried one meal day accidentally consistently accidentally like think makes feel good much much hit currently two meals day six nonstop one meal day interesting interesting feeling ever fasted longer day yeah done bunch water fasts curious happens happens anything interesting yeah would say mean interesting hungry two days starting day three hungry like weird feeling eaten days hungry weird really weird one many weird things human biology figure something finds another source energy something like relaxes system know works yeah body like hungry hungry gives like okay guess fasting nothing kind like focuses trying make hungry feel damage trying give space figure food situation still day productive night would say really hard maintain phd schedule especially say working tesla nonstarter even people want meet various events society lives certain period time sort work hard social thing return work yeah really hard try social things try much drinking return continue work tesla conversions tesla company convergence towards schedule humans behave collaborate need learn try keep consistent schedule awake time try create routine try create steady state comfortable morning routine day routine try keep things steady state things predictable sort like body sort like sticks try stress little much create traveling dealing jet lag able really ascend need go yeah yeah humans habits stuff thoughts balance throughout human lifetime tesla part known sort pushing people limits terms able terms trying terms much work kind stuff yeah mean say tesla gets much bad rep happening tesla bursty environment would say baseline point reference google interned three times saw like inside google deepmind would say baseline higher punctuated equilibrium fire people work really hard spiky bursty stories get collected bursts gives appearance total insanity actually bit intense environment fires sprints think definitely though would say intense environment something would get google person forget personal life think happiness human brilliant person like finding balance work life thing good thought experiment yeah think balance good also love sprints distribution think pretty creative well sprints distribution means time quote unquote balance balance time like obsessed something week month year yeah probably like say month something yeah get new github repo monitoring yeah really care problem must exist awesome obsessed ca day need pay fixed cost getting groove need stay society come try mess try distract yeah worst thing person like need five minutes time cost five minutes society needs change thinks five minutes time right never one minute seconds quick thing big deal yeah computer setup like perfect somebody flexible matter laptop four screens prefer certain setup productive guess one familiar one large screen inch laptop side operating system macs primary tasks would say os x working deep learning everything linux ssh cluster working remotely actual development like using ide yeah would use think good way run vs code favorite editor right mac actually remote folder ssh actual files manipulating cluster somewhere else best ide vs code else people use emacs still cool may cool know maximum productivity recommend terms editors worked lot software engineers editors python machine learning applications think current answer vs code currently believe best ide got huge amount extensions github copilot integration think valuable think copilot integration actually got talk bunch guido nrasim creator python loves copilot like programs lot yeah yeah use copilot love free would pay yeah think good utility found would say learning curve need figure helpful pay attention outputs going helpful pay attention reading suggestions time good way interacting think able sort mold find helpful number one copy paste replace parts pattern clear really good completing pattern number two sometimes suggests apis aware tells something know opportunity discover new api opportunity would never take copilot code given almost always copy copy paste google search see function like oh actually exactly need thank copilot learn something part search engine part maybe getting exact syntax correctly see thing see know correct correct struggle verify efficiently ca generate efficiently copilot really mean autopilot programming right currently lane following like simple copy paste sometimes suggest time going become autonomous thing play coding actually across many many different things probably coding important one right writing programs see future developing program synthesis like able write programs complicated right human supervised interesting ways yes feels like transition painful mental model thing happen autopilot currently lane following simple stuff eventually autonomy people intervene less less could like testing mechanisms like writes function function looks pretty damn correct know correct like getting lazier lazier programmer like ability like little bugs guess wo make little mistakes copilot make one subtle bugs done think future systems really one actually fundamental challenge programming case fundamental think things improve yeah think humans supervise nervous people supervising comes happens example proliferation bugs systems nervous think probably copilots bug finding stuff like point cause like lot automation oh man like program copilot generates compiler one linter yes one like type checker yeah yeah committee like gpt sort like like manager committee yeah somebody says new version needed need regenerate yeah gpts forwarded gave suggestions another one looked picked like bug one looked like probably bug got thing final ensemble gpt comes like okay given everything guys told probably next token know feeling number programmers world growing growing quickly think possible actually level drop like low number kind world cause software programming kind generation copilot type systems programming wo old school software programming currently think going replace human programmers hesitant saying stuff like right going replaced five years know going show like thought cause agree think might surprised right like next sense stand language models like feel like beginning middle end beginning think big question mind sure gpt able program quite well competently steer system still provide guidance actually looking steer say talk audit verify done correct like work much ai problem ui ux problem yeah beautiful fertile ground much interesting work vs code plus plus human programming anymore amazing yeah interacting system one prompt iterative prompting yeah trying figure conversation system yeah actually mean super exciting conversation program writing yeah maybe point conversing like okay want actually variable maybe even low level variable also imagine like translate c plus plus back python back yeah already kind exists ways like part program experience like think like write function c plus plus like keep changing different programs different syntax maybe want convert functional language yeah like get become multilingual programmer dance back forth efficiently yeah mean think ui ux though like still hard think writing code page entire developer environment bunch hardware environmental variables scripts running chrome job like lot going like working computers systems set environment flags work across multiple machines set screen sessions automate different processes like works auditable humans like massive question moment built archive sanity archive future academic research publishing would like see archive preprint server paper submit publication journals conferences wait six months maybe get decision pass fail upload archive people tweet three minutes later everyone sees everyone reads everyone profit way cite official look feels like publication process yeah put blog post oh yeah yeah mean paper usually bar higher something would expect archive opposed something would see blog post well culture created bar could probably post pretty crappy picture archive make feel like make feel peer review rigorous peer review two three experts versus peer review community right written yeah basically think community well able peer review things quickly twitter think maybe something ai machine learning field specifically though feel like things easily auditable verification easier potentially verification somewhere else kind like think scientific publications like little blockchains everyone building work citing sort ai kind like much faster loose blockchain one individual entry like cheap make fields maybe model make much sense think ai least things pretty easily verifiable people upload papers really good idea people try like next day final arbiter whether works problem whole thing moves significantly faster kind feel like academia still place like conference journal process still place sort like lags behind think bit maybe higher quality process sort place discover cutting edge work anymore used case starting phd go conferences journals discuss latest research go conference journal like one discusses anything already like three generations ago irrelevant yeah makes sad like deepmind example still publish nature big prestigious mean still value suppose prestige comes big venues result announce breakthrough performance take like year actually publish details mean details published immediately would inspire community move certain directions yeah would speed rest community know extent part objective function also true prestige little bit delay part yeah certainly deepmind specifically working regime slightly higher quality basically process latency publishing papers way another question reddit suffered imposter syndrome director ai tesla person stanford like world looks expert ai teach world machine learning leaving tesla five years spent ton time meeting rooms would read papers beginning joined tesla writing code writing less less code reading code reading less less code natural progression happens think definitely would say near tail end sort like starts hit bit supposed expert actually source truth code people writing github actual code familiar used would say maybe like insecurity yeah actually pretty profound lot insecurity writing code computer science space like truth right code source truth papers everything else high level summary yeah high level summary end day read code impossible translate code actual know paper form things come especially source code available favorite place go like said one greatest teachers machine learning ai ever csn today advice would give beginners interested getting machine learning beginners often focused like think focus like much kind like believer high level hours kind concept kind pick things spend time care interested literally put hours work even like matter much like put iterate improve waste time know better way need put hours think actually really nice feel like sense determinism expert thing spend hours literally pick arbitrary thing think spend hours deliberate effort work actually become expert think kind like nice thought basically would focus like spending hours would focus thinking kind mechanisms maximize likelihood getting hours exactly us silly humans means probably forming daily habit like every single day actually thing whatever helps think large extent psychological problem one thing think helpful psychology many times people compare others area think harmful compare time ago like say year ago better year ago way think think see progress motivating interesting focus quantity hours think lot people beginner stage actually throughout get paralyzed choice like one pick path path like literally get paralyzed like id use well worried things thing waste time something wrong eventually figure right accumulate scar tissue next time grow stronger next time scar tissue next time learn next time come similar situation like oh messed spent lot time working things never materialized anything scar tissue intuitions useful useful things turned mistakes dead work think focus working done done last week good question actually ask lot things machine learning good way cut forgot term used fluff blubber whatever inefficiencies life love teaching seem find often like drawn teaching good also drawn mean think love teaching love happy humans happy humans like teach would say hate teaching tolerate teaching like act teaching like know something actually okay okay teaching people appreciate lot happy try helpful teaching like mean really annoying really annoying frustrating working bunch lectures reminded back days much work create materials make good amount iteration thought go blind alleys much change creating something good terms like educational values really hard fun difficult people definitely go watch new stuff put lectures actually building thing like like said code truth discussing back propagation building looking whole thing difficult prepare think really powerful way teach prepare live thinking typically like say three takes take like better take multiple takes take better takes build lecture way sometimes delete minutes content went alley like much bunch iteration probably takes somewhere around hours create one hour content get one hour interesting mean difficult go back basics draw lot like wisdom going back basics yeah going back back propagation loss functions come one thing like teaching lot honestly definitely strengthens understanding purely altruistic activity way learn explain something someone realize gaps knowledge even surprised lectures like oh result obviously look result look like like okay thought understood yeah yeah really cool literally code run notebook gives result like oh wow yes like actual numbers actual input actual code yeah mathematical symbols et cetera source truth code slides like let build beautiful rare human sense advice would give researchers trying develop publish idea big impact world ai maybe undergrads maybe early graduate students yeah mean would say like definitely little bit strategic phd student way ai evolving going way physics physics used able experiments bench top everything great could make progress work like lhc like cern ai going direction well certain kinds things possible bench top anymore think used case time still think like gan type papers written like simple idea requires one computer illustrate simple example mean one example influential recently diffusion models diffusion models amazing diffusion models six years old longest time people kind ignoring far tell amazing generative model especially images stable diffusion diffusion based diffusion new came well came google researcher could come fact first actually came google well researcher could come academic institution yeah find fascinating diffusion models societal impact technical architecture like diffusion works well surprising amount variety almost novelty synthetic data generating yeah stable diffusion images incredible speed improvement generating images insane went quickly generating like tiny digits tiny faces looked messed stable diffusion happened quickly lot academia still contribute example flash attention efficient kernel running attention operation inside transformer came academic environment clever way structure kernel calculation materialize attention matrix think still like lots things contribute strategic think neural networks made reason yes think already reason yes definition reasoning information processing way humans think problem come novel ideas feels like reasoning yeah novelty wan na say distribution ideas think possible yes think seeing already current neural nets able remix training set information true generalization sense appear fundamental way training set like something interesting algorithmically manipulating symbols coming correct unique answer new setting would illustrate holy shit thing definitely thinking thinking reasoning information processing generalization think neural nets already today able perceive world perceive whatever inputs make predictions based actions based reasoning yeah giving correct answers novel settings manipulating information learned correct algorithm kind lookup table neighbor search something like let ask agi moonshot ideas think might make significant progress towards agi maybe ways big blockers missing basically fairly bullish ability build agi basically automated systems interact interact digital realm physical realm currently seems models sort sort magical tasks text realm think mentioned suspicious text realm enough actually build full understanding world actually think need go pixels understand physical world works think need extend models consume images videos train lot data multimodal way think need touch world understand also well big open question would say mind also require embodiment ability sort interact world run experiments data form need go optimus something like would say optimus way like hedge agi seems possible data internet enough case optimus may lead agi optimus nothing beyond optimus like humanoid form factor actually like stuff world millions interacting humans give rise agi point like sure completeness perspective think really good platform much harder platform dealing atoms need actually like build things integrate society think path takes longer much certain path internet like training compression models effectively trying compress internet might also give agents well compress internet also interact internet obvious fact suspect reach agi without ever entering physical world little bit concerning results happening faster feels like boiling water wo know happening would like afraid agi excited always concerns would like know happens yeah like hints happens like year happen kind thing feel like digital realm might happen yeah think available us one built agi available us enough fertile ground periphery would say yes progress far rapid next steps available would say yeah quite likely interacting digital entities know somebody built agi going slow think going slow incremental transition going focused going github getting better gpt helping write oracles go mathematical problems think verge able ask complex questions chemistry physics math oracles complete solutions agi use primarily focused intelligence consciousness enter mind consciousness special thing figure bolt think emergent phenomenon large enough complex enough generative model complex enough world model understands world also understands predicament world language model form consciousness order understand world deeply probably integrate world order interact humans living beings consciousness useful tool think consciousness like modeling insight modeling insight yeah powerful enough model understanding world actually understand entity yeah also perhaps narrative tell feels like something experience world hard problem consciousness could narrative tell yeah think emerge think going something boring like talking digital ais claim conscious appear conscious things would expect humans going stalemate think lot actual fascinating ethical questions like supreme court level questions whether allowed turn conscious ai allowed build conscious ai maybe would kind debase around sorry bring political topic abortion deeper question abortion life deep question ai also life conscious think fascinating bring might become illegal build systems capable level intelligence consciousness would emerge therefore capacity suffer would emerge system says please kill well lambda chatbot already told google engineer right like talking wanting die might become illegal right otherwise might lot creatures want die spawn infinity cluster might lead horrible consequences might lot people secretly love murder start practicing murder systems mean stuff brings beautiful mirror human condition human nature get explore best supreme court different debates ideas means human get ask deep questions asking throughout human history always human history good guys bad guys going throughout human history let murder bad guys probably happen robots first get ask questions mean alive mean conscious yeah think canary coal mines even today example waifus work people trying like company going shut person really loved waifu trying port somewhere else possible think definitely people feelings towards systems sense like mirror humanity sort like big average humanity way trained average actually watch nice able interact big average humanity like search query yeah yeah fascinating course also like shape pure average mess training data mess objective fine tune various ways impact systems look like want achieve agi could conversation ask talk anything maybe ask question kind stuff would ask would practical questions mind like loved ones really die think answer clearly would answer poetically would expect give solutions would expect like well read textbooks know things produced seems like experiments think would useful run next gene therapies think would helpful kinds experiments run okay let go thought experiment okay imagine mortality actually like prerequisite happiness become immortal actually become deeply unhappy model able know supposed tell stupid human yes become immortal become deeply unhappy agi system trying empathize human supposed tell yes die really gon na like gon na deeply honest like interstellar ai says like humans want honesty yeah like pick honest wan na answer practical questions yeah love ai interstellar way think like sidekick entire story time like really interesting kind limited certain ways right yeah limited think totally fine way think think fine plausible limited imperfect agi feature almost example like fixed amount compute physical body might even though super amazing mega brain super intelligent ai also like know less intelligent ais deploy power efficient way perfect might make mistakes meant like say infinite compute still good make mistakes sometimes like order integrate like going back good hunting robin williams character says like human imperfections good stuff right like want perfect want flaws part form connections feels like something attach feelings flaws way want ai flawed know feel like perfection cool saying okay yeah agi see agi would need intelligent enough give answers humans humans understand think perfect something humans ca understand even science give perfect answers always gaps mysteries know know humans want perfect yeah could imagine conversation kind oracle entity imagine yeah maybe tell based analysis human condition might want things might every dumb human say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah trust give truth handle beauty people choose old marshmallow test kids feel like many people ca handle truth probably including deep truth human condition know handle dark alien science experiment realizes mean mean matrix know would talk even yeah probably go safer scientific questions first nothing personal life mortality like physics build like let see maybe see sense humor another question would able presumably order understands humans deeply would able generate humor yeah think actually wonderful benchmark almost like able think really good point basically make laugh yeah able like effective standup comedian something interesting computationally think funny extremely hard yeah hard way like turing test original intent turing test hard convince humans nothing comedians talk like deeply honest people ca help laugh laugh means funny laugh funny showing need lot knowledge create humor like mentioned human condition need clever mentioned movies tweeted movies seen five plus times ready willing keep watching interstellar gladiator contact good hunting matrix lord rings three avatar fifth element goes terminator mean girls gon na ask think man mean girls great somewhat jump onto memory love like mentioned matrix computer person love matrix many properties make beautiful interesting philosophical questions also agi simulation cool black know look feel yeah look feel action bullet time innovating many ways good hunting like one yeah really like tortured genius sort character grappling whether responsibility gift given think whole thing also dance genius personal means love another human lot themes beautiful movie fatherly figure mentor psychiatrist really messes movies really mess deep level relate movie fault andre said lord rings terminator interesting rewatched lot better terminator like arnold kid like terminator well like terminator little bit terms surface properties think skynet possibility yes like actual autonomous weapon system kind thing worry stuff worry ai used war worry fears agi plan mean powerful entities probably point long time going tools hands humans people talk alignment agi make problem even humans aligned used going look like yeah troubling think happen slowly enough able human civilization think problems yes hope happens slowly enough open enough way lot people see participate figure deal transition think going interesting draw lot inspiration nuclear weapons sure thought would fucked developed nuclear weapons almost like systems dangerous destroy human civilization deploy learn lessons quickly dangerous quickly quickly might still deploy quickly learn use balance achieved humans clever species interesting exploit resources much avoid destroying seems like well know actually hope continues mean definitely concerned nuclear weapons result recent conflict even probably number one concern humanity humanity destroys destroys people would nukes think even full destruction bad enough reset society would terrible would really bad ca believe close crazy feels like might tweets away something like yep basically extremely unnerving long time seems unstable world leaders bad mood take one step towards bad direction escalates yeah collection bad moods escalate without able stop yeah huge amount power also proliferation basically actually really see actually know good outcomes definitely worried lot agi currently think point become something like danger agi even think even slightly worse sense good outcomes agi bad outcomes like epsilon away like tiny one away think capitalism humanity drive positive ways using technology bad outcomes like tiny flip minus sign away really bad position tiny perturbation system results destruction human species weird line walk yeah think general really weird dynamics humanity explosion talked like insane coupling afforded technology instability whole dynamical system think look good honestly yeah explosion could destructive constructive probabilities ends mean feel like try optimistic think even case still predominantly optimistic definitely think become species probably yes know dominant feature future humanity might people planets sure like major player culture still solve drivers earth backup mars going solve problem way love backup mars think amazing absolutely yes thankful anyone would go mars personally like earth quite lot go mars go tweet maybe eventually would safe enough actually know lifetime scale unless extend lot think example lot people might disappear virtual realities stuff like think could major thrust cultural development humanity survives might really hard work physical realm go think ultimately experiences brain much easier disappear digital realm think people find compelling easier safer interesting little bit captivated virtual reality possible worlds whether metaverse manifestation yeah yeah really interesting interested talking lot carmack thing currently preventing yeah mean clear think interesting future kind feel like variance human condition grows primary thing changing much mean distribution variance probably people mars people vr people earth like many ways kind feel like see like spreading human experience something internet allows discover little groups gravitate something biology likes kind world find yeah transhumanists amish everything going coexist cool thing interacted bunch internet communities know happy existence like community knowing even sense traveled ukraine know many things america travel across world think experience certain cultures like thing going see happening future little communities yeah yeah think seems going right see trend really reversing think people diverse able choose path existence celebrate spend much time metaverse virtual reality community physicalist physical reality enjoyer see drawing lot pleasure fulfillment digital world yeah think well currently virtual reality compelling think improve lot really know extent maybe actually even exotic things think neural links stuff like currently see mostly team human person love nature love harmony love people love humanity love emotions humanity want solar punk little utopia happy place happy place people love thinking cool problems surrounded lush beautiful dynamic nature secretly high tech places count places count use technology empower love humans nature yeah think technology used sparingly love gets way humanity many ways like people humans way sort slightly evolved prefer think default people kept asking know love reading particular books enjoyed impact silly profound reasons would recommend mentioned vital question many course think biology example vital question good one anything nic lane really life ascending would say bit potentially representative summary lot things talking impacted selfish gene thought really good book helped understand altruism example comes realizing selection level genes huge insight time sort cleared lot things think idea ideas organisms means love able walk around notion evolutionary kind process ideas well absolutely memes like genes compete live brains beautiful silly humans thinking organisms possible primary organisms ideas yeah would say ideas kind live software civilization minds think humans hardware fundamental thing human hardware entity could software yeah yeah would say needs grounding point physical reality clone andre software thing thing makes thing special right yeah guess right cloning might exceptionally difficult might deep integration software hardware ways quite understand well ultimate point view makes special like gang genes writing chromosomes suppose replicating unit suppose thing makes special sure well reality makes special ability survive based software runs hardware built genes software thing makes survive hardware little bit like second layer new second layer brain coexist also layers software mean abstraction top abstractions ok selfless gene nick lane would say sometimes books sufficient like reach textbooks sometimes kind feel like books much general consumption sometimes high level abstraction good enough like textbooks like cell think cell pretty cool also like writing nick lane pretty willing step one level yeah willing go also willing throughout stack go lot detail come back think yeah basically really appreciate love college early college even high school textbooks basics computer science mathematics biology chemistry yes condensed sufficiently general understand philosophy details also get homework problems get play much would programming stuff yeah also suspicious textbooks honestly example deep learning amazing textbooks feel changing quickly imagine true say synthetic biology books like cell kind outdated still high level actual real source truth people wet labs working cells sequencing genomes actually working much exposure looks like still fully reading cell kind interesting learning still sufficient would say terms understanding well clean summarization mainstream narrative learn break towards cutting edge yeah actual process working cells growing incubating kind like massive cooking recipe making sure cells live proliferate sequencing running experiments works think kind like source truth end day really useful terms creating therapies yeah wonder future ai textbooks artificial intelligence modern approach actually read come recent version recent recent addition also saw science deep learning book waiting textbook worth recommending worth reading yeah tricky like papers code code code honestly find papers quite good especially like appendix paper well like detail ha ha ha cohesive connect anything else describe specific way saw particular thing yeah many times papers actually quite readable always sometimes introduction abstract readable even someone outside field always true sometimes think unfortunately scientists use complex terms even necessary think harmful think reason papers sometimes longer need parts matter yeah appendix would long paper look einstein make simple yeah certainly come across papers would say synthetic biology something thought quite readable abstract introduction reading rest fully understand kind getting gist think cool advice give advice folks interested machine learning research general life advice young person high school early college career proud life proud yeah think hesitant give general advice think really hard mentioned stuff mentioned fairly general think like focus amount work spending thing compare others good think fairly general pick thing deep interest something try find argmax things interested argmax moment stick get distracted switch another thing like well argmax repeatedly every week every month converge problem yeah low pass filter terms consistently true yeah definitely see hard would say going work hardest thing care low pass filter really introspect past things gave energy things took energy away concrete examples usually concrete examples sometimes patterns emerge like things look like positions necessarily field kind stuff particular field seems like energized implementing stuff building actual things yeah low level learning also communicating others go realizations shortening gap usually way much work understand thing like ok actually like ok think get much work much less work gives lot frustration sometimes go teach aside teaching putting videos aside potential godfather part ii agi tesla beyond future ranjha kapothi hold figured yet mean see fog war future start seeing silhouettes possible future could look like consistent thing always interested least ai probably spending rest life care lot actually care many problems well like say aging basically view disease care well think good idea go specifically actually think humans able come answer think correct thing ignore problems solve ai use solve everything else think chance work think high chance kind like way betting least think ai interested kinds applications kinds domains domain focus allow get insights big problem agi yeah ultimate meta problem want work one specific problem many problems work problems simultaneously solve meta problem intelligence automate cool small projects like archive sanity thinking ml world anticipate always fun side projects archive sanity one basically way many archive papers organize recommend papers transcribed podcasts learn experience transcribing process like like consuming audiobooks podcasts process achieves closer human level performance annotation yeah well definitely surprised transcription openeye whisper working well compared familiar siri systems guess worked well gave energy try thought could fun run podcasts kind obvious whisper much better compared anything else feel like lot incentive lot companies produce transcription systems done long time whisper super exotic model transformer takes mel spectrograms outputs tokens text crazy model everything around long time actually sure came obvious either makes feel like missing something missing something yeah huge even google youtube transcription yeah unclear also integrating bigger system user interface deployed kind stuff maybe running independent thing much easier like order magnitude easier deploying large integrated system like youtube transcription anything like meetings zoom transcription kind crappy creating interface detects different individual speakers able display compelling ways run real time kind stuff maybe difficult explanation currently paying quite bit human transcription human caption annotation seems like huge incentive automate confusing think mean know looked whisper transcripts quite good good especially tricky cases seen whisper performance super tricky cases incredibly well know podcast pretty simple like high quality audio speaking usually pretty clearly know know openai plans either yeah always like fun projects basically stable diffusion also opening huge amount experimentation would say visual realm generating images videos movies ultimately yeah videos going pretty crazy going almost certainly work going really interesting cost content creation going fall zero used need painter months paint thing going speak phone get video hollywood start using generate scenes completely opens yeah make movie like avatar eventually million dollars much less maybe talking phone mean know sounds kind crazy voting mechanism like like would show netflix generated completely automatically potentially yeah look like also generate demand infinity yeah oh man synthetic art mean humbling treat special able generate art ideas kind stuff done automated way ai yeah think fascinating predictions ai going look like going capable completely inverted wrong like totally right imagined ai like super calculating theory improvers getting things talk emotions art like weird excited future ai like hybrid systems heterogeneous systems humans ai talking emotions netflix children ai system netflix thing watch also generated ai think going interesting sure think cautiously optimistic obvious well sad thing brain mine developed time twitter internet wonder people born inside might different experience like maybe still resist people born well feel like humans extremely malleable yeah probably right meaning life andre talked sort universe conversation us humans systems create try answer universe creator universe notice us trying create systems loud enough answer back know meaning life like meaning life people first level answer would say anyone choose meaning life conscious entity beautiful number one think like deeper meaning life someone interested along lines like hell like look fundamental physics quantum field theory standard model like complicated like free parameters universe like going stuff hack work message supposed create message think fundamental answers think actually even like ca actually like really make dent without time also big question around getting time honestly yeah kind like think quite bit well kind ultimate least first way sneak question try escape system universe sort backtrack say okay gon na take long time question boils engineering perspective extend yeah think question number one practically speaking ca gon na calculate answer deeper questions time could extending lifetime extending lifetime human civilization whoever wants many people might want think people want think probably possible know people fully realize kind feel like people think death inevitability end day physical system things go wrong makes sense things like happen evolutionarily speaking certainly interventions mitigate interesting death eventually looked fascinating thing used happen humans think unlikely think likely imagination try predict world without death looks like yeah think values completely change could really buy ideas oh without death meaning nothing intuitively buy arguments think plenty meaning plenty things learn interesting exciting want know want calculate want improve condition humans organisms alive yeah way find meaning might change lot humans probably including finds meaning finiteness things mean source meaning yeah think many people go think great love idea people choose adventure like born conscious free entity default like think unalienable rights life pursuit happiness know nature landscape happiness choose adventure mostly fully true still pretty sure npc npc ca know npc could different degrees levels consciousness think beautiful way end andre incredible person really honored would talk everything done machine learning world ai world inspire people educate millions people great ca wait see next honor man thank much talking awesome thank thanks listening conversation andre karpathy support podcast

problem space much richer studied lab sense data camaai tesla autopilot perhaps others like cadillac supercruiser collecting gives us chance understand design safe vehicles real human beings real world conditions think requires bold innovation serious exploration first principles driving task enjoyed thing subscribe youtube review five stars apple podcasts follow spotify support patreon connect twitter lex friedman conversation george hotz last time started talking simulation time let ask think intelligent life universe always maintained answer fermi paradox think intelligent life elsewhere universe intelligent civilizations existed blown general intuition intelligent civilizations quickly like parameter drake equation sense last long like lasted pretty good oh oh yeah mean quite yet well wait like call iq required destroy world falls one point every year okay technology democratizes destruction world meme destroy world kind already right somewhat think seen anywhere near worst yet world going get weird well maybe meme save world thought meme lord elon musk fighting side good versus meme lord darkness saying anything bad donald trump lord meme dark side darth vader memes think every fairy tale always end lived happily ever like please tell happily ever heard marriages end divorce marriage end ca say happily ever thing destruction destruction everything right order avoid one thing wrong mean actually really like cryptography cryptography seems like live world defense wins versus like nuclear weapons opposite true much easier build warhead splits hundred little warheads build something take hundred little warheads offense advantage maybe future crypto cryptography right goliath defense different hackers davids equation flipped nuclear war cause many like one nuclear weapon destroys everything essentially yeah much easier attack nuclear weapon like technology required intercept destroy rocket much complicated technology required know orbital trajectory send rocket somebody okay intuition intelligent civilizations possible longer kind sad picture enter steady state wirehead wirehead stimulate pleasure centers know live forever kind stasis become well mean think reason believe reason stopped expanding otherwise would taken universe universe big least know let talk galaxy right light years across took number star trek voyager know true yeah big light years nothing possible technology imagine could leverage like wormholes something like even need wormholes von neumann probe enough von neumann probe million years sublight travel taken whole universe clearly happen something stopped mean right like million years sent probes travel close sublight meaning close speed light let say spreads interesting actually interesting calculation huh makes think able communicate like yeah think would able comprehend intelligent lives like even among us kind thing like even flying around well mean possible possible sort prime directive really cool universe live reason making visible us makes sense would use well least entropy well implying laws physics know mean entropy case oh yeah mean entropy scarce resource universe think like stephen wolfram everything computation traveling world computation think universe information processing referring entropy pockets interesting complex computations swimming around know already know like different amazing things full mystery earth like little footprints intelligence light years away maybe mean tend think civilizations expand use energy never overcome problem waste heat waste heat able crude methods able see like whole lot energy could something mean understand dark energy right dark matter could stuff understand fundamentally different physics know like even comprehend well think ok mean depends far want go think physics different side galaxy would suspect mean universe physics well yeah assumption could like super trippy things like like cognition gets slice possible instruments design get particular slice universe something much like weirder maybe try thought experiment would people past able detect remnants would able detect modern civilization think answer obviously yes mean past hundred years ago well let even go back let go million years ago humans lying around desert probably even maybe barely fire would understand flew overhead vicinity flew mars would able see far actually communicating well rest universe okay sending random like fifties tracks music true yeah mean know broadcasting radio waves years well light cone yeah okay make recently came across talked david fravor know caught videos pentagon released new york times reporting ufo sightings kind looked quote unquote actually like hundreds thousands ufo sightings right lot explain away different kinds ways one could interesting physical phenomena could people wanting believe therefore conjure lot different things know see different kinds lights basic physics phenomena conjure ideas possible mysterious worlds know also possible like case um david fravor navy pilot know legit guest terms humans able perceive things environment make conclusions whether things threat several pilots saw thing know followed saw thing since called tech talk moved kinds weird ways know could technology developed united states aware surface level navy right could different kinds lighting technology drone technology kind stuff could russians chinese kind stuff course mind mind also venture possibility another world looked think think news psyop think plausible nothing real yeah listened think bob lazar joe rogan like believe everything guy saying think probably like mkultra kind thing know mean like know made weird thing called alien spaceship know like stimulate young physicists minds tell alien technology see come right find conspiracy theories compelling like pulled string rich complex world conspiracy theories think heard conspiracy theory conspiracy theories invented cia sixties discredit true things yeah know go ridiculous conspiracy theories like flat earth pizza gate know things almost hide like conspiracy theories like know remember chinese like locked doctors discovered coronavirus like tell people like conspiracy theory actually happened remember time money used backed gold backed nothing conspiracy theory actually happened one worries today idea fake news nothing real like dilute possibility anything true conjuring kinds conspiracy theories know believe like idea truth objectivity lost completely everybody truth used control information censoring internet happened governments like oh shit ca censor things anymore know know old story story like tying flag leprechaun tells gold buried tie one flag make leprechaun swear remove flag come back field later shovel flags everywhere one way maintain privacy right like order protect contents conversation example could generate like millions deep fake conversations talk say random things one nobody knows one real one could fake right classics steganography technique okay another absurd question intelligent life know incredible programmer outside everything else talk programmer think intelligent beings civilizations computers programming naturally develop something engineer machines able encode knowledge machines instructions process knowledge process information make decisions actions would programming languages think exist similar anything developed see much difference quote unquote natural languages programming languages think many similarities asked question alien languages look like imagine dissimilar think translating uh would crazy difficult compile like dna python see mean little bit gap kind languages use uh touring machines kind languages nature seems use little bit maybe understood kind language nature uses well yet dna cad model quite programming language sort serial uh execution quite uh yeah cad model um think sense actually completely understand problem um know uh well simulating cad models played bit year super uh computationally intensive want go like molecular level um need go see lot phenomenon like protein folding um yeah understand requires whole lot compute kind compile human minds inefficient pro data representation programming yeah runs well raw nature runs well raw nature try build uh emulators simulators uh well mad slow tried runs yeah commented elsewhere remember uh one problems simulating nature tough want sort uh deploy prototype forgot put made laugh animals humans would need involved order order try run prototype code um like talking covid viruses tried engineer kind defense mechanisms like vaccine covid kind stuff kind experimentation like like autonomous vehicles would technically cost technically ethically costly sure think tons uh crazy biology test tubes think bigger complaint oh tools bad like literally mean like like libraries pipetting shit like handing got ta like automating stuff like yeah human biology messy like seems like look doranos videos joke like like little gantry like little xy gantry high school science project pipette like really got something better ca build like nice microfluidics program know computation bio interface mean going happen like right asking pipette milliliters solution crude yeah let get crazy way bunch people asked since talked simulation last time talked hacking simulation updates insights might able go hacking simulation indeed live simulation think lot people misinterpreted point south talk point south talk literally hack simulation think idea literally think theoretical physics think whole know whole goal right want grand unified theory okay build grand unified theory search exploits right think nowhere near actually yet hope like people kidding things spend time thinking understand like kind small bytes god computer really things people get worked know basically message humble get like humans bytecode yeah humble like like trying like make people feel guilty anything like trying say like literally look spending time right referring referring kardashians talking referring kardashians see everyone knows kind fun referring like economy know idea got stock price like goal function humanity like game capitalism like like games constructed humans big fan capitalism think really game playing right think playing different game rules rigged okay games interesting humans constructed productive actually maybe real point talk like stop playing fake human games real game play real game real game know nature wrote rules real game still game play look sorry interrupt know seen instagram account nature metal game nature seems playing lot lot cruel humans want put least see cruel like bigger thing eats smaller thing impress another big thing mate thing seems entirety well art music comma ai comma one comma two george hots brilliant talks south southwest see disagree though disagree nature think nature provided basically open world mmorpg know open world mean game want play play game beautiful know played diablo used think cow level everybody go figured like best way gain like experience points slaughter cows figured little sub game within bigger game efficient way get experience points everybody somehow agreed getting experience points rpg context always want getting stuff skills levels keep advancing seems good might well spend sacrifice actual enjoyment playing game exploring world spending like hundreds hours time college mean number hours spent cow level like impressive person people probably thousands hours ridiculous little absurd game brought joy weird dopamine drug kind way like games think us humans failing nature think point talk yeah hack well want live forever want live forever goal well game nature yeah immortality good objective function mean start whatever else want got long time immortality makes game totally fun mean like assume immortality somehow good objective function immortality want true immortality could die would prefer right want choose death course want nature decide die going win going point choose commit suicide like long think live get bored see think people like like brilliant people like really ponder living long time really considering meaningless life becomes well want know everything ready die long yeah want possible want know everything finite like reason want know quote unquote everything enough time know everything unlimited time realize like anything like learn anything want know everything ready die yeah well terminal value service anything else conscious possibility certainty possibility engine curiosity speaking actually symptom finiteness life like without finiteness curiosity would vanish like morning fog right cool wachowski talked love like let solve immortality let change thing brain reminds fact immortal tells life finite shit maybe tell life ends next week right okay self manipulation like okay deceiving oh rika changing code problem right problem longer curiosity like backup copies check occasionally make sure okay trajectory kind override maybe nice like think like wave nets like logarithmic go back copy sometimes reversible like done video games figure cheat code like look cheat old school like single player ruins game absolutely know feeling means brain manipulation technology good enough yet remove cheat code brain call also possible figure immortality us kill advance far enough able revert change killing till know everything say life finite think yes systems comes hairy complexities promise perfectly think put good safety structures place talk thinking literally referring simulation universe kind computer program running computer thought experiment also think potential sort bostrom elon musk others talk actual program simulates universe oh doubt simulation think quite important mean interested simulation theory far gives power nature totally unfalsifiable cares mean think experiment would look like somebody twitter asked ask george signs would look know whether simulation exactly asking step precedes step knowing get power knowledge get indication power gained get indication discover exploit cracks simulation physics universe show mean like memory leak would cool scrying technology know kind technology scrying oh weird scrying paranormal ability like remote viewing like able see somewhere think chanting room could find memory leak basically memory leak yeah able access parts supposed thereby discover shortcut memory leak means thing well mean like yeah like ability read arbitrary memory one horrifying right ones start horrifying read right reading problem yeah like heartfleet universe oh boy writing big big problem big problem moment write anything even random noise terrifying mean even without like even nanotech stuff coming think know paying attention actually eric weinstein came theory everything mean came working theory everything physics world called geometric unity computer science person like stephen wolfram theory everything like hypergraphs super interesting beautiful physics perspective computational perspective know paid attention like would make pay attention like hate string theory okay make testable prediction right interested interested theories intrinsic beauty interested theories give power universe theories interested say beautiful lot physicists say interested experimental validation skip part say give power universe love clarity want gigahertz processors want transistors smaller atoms want like power true people aliens kind technology people worried governments like owns power george hotz thousands distributed hackers across world governments mark zuckerberg lot people know anyone trusts one individual power always worried beauty blockchains beauty blockchains talk twitter somebody pointed story bunch people pointed story months ago went restaurant new york correct wrong ran bunch folks crypto company trying scale ethereum technical deadline related solidity ovm compiler ethereum technologies stepped recognized pulled aside explained problem stepped helped solve problem thereby creating legend status story tell story little detail seems kind incredible happen yeah yeah true story true story mean wrote flattering account company called optimism plasma trying build l solutions ethereum right every ethereum node run every transaction ethereum network kind scale right n computers well becomes two n computers actually still get amount compute like scaling run okay fine get blockchain security blockchain already secure trade speed kind l solutions built thing kind sandbox ethereum contracts run l world ca certain things l world ask definitions l oh l layer l like base ethereum chain layer like computational layer runs elsewhere still kind secured layer sure lot people know ethereum cryptocurrency probably one popular cryptocurrencies second bitcoin lot interesting technological innovations maybe could also slip whenever talk things exciting ethereum space ethereum well mean bitcoin tearing complete ethereum technically tearing complete gas limit close enough gas limit gas limit resources yeah mean computer actually tearing complete right going find ram know actually solve whole thing word gas limit many brilliant words even going ask word ethereum word gas limit ethereum spend gas per instruction like different opcodes use different amounts gas buy gas ether prevent people basically ddosing network bitcoin proof work ethereum also proof work working proof stake ethereum stuff right proof work uses different hash function bitcoin asic resistance need ram talking ethereum trying scale whole process like well could run contracts elsewhere save results computation know well actually compute chain compute chain post results problem well somebody could lie results need resolution mechanism resolution mechanism really expensive know make sure like person saying look swear real computation staking fact prove wrong yeah might cost gas fees prove wrong get bounty secure using kinds systems effectively sandbox runs contracts like kind normal sandbox like replace syscalls know calls hypervisor sandbox syscalls hypervisor things mean long interesting talk yeah mean take like chrome sandbox maybe one think right chrome process rendering ca example read file file system yeah someone tries make open syscall linux open syscall ca make open syscall request kind hypervisor process like know called chrome hey could open file checks passes file handle back approved got yeah context ethereum boundaries sandbox talking well like one calls actually reading writing state ethereum contract ethereum blockchain writing state one calls going sandbox layer two let layer two arbitrarily write ethereum blockchain layer two really sitting top layer one going lot different kinds ideas play fundamentally changing source code level ethereum well replace bunch calls calls hypervisor instead syscall directly replace call hypervisor originally first running solidity language ethereum contracts written compiles bytecode wrote thing call transpiler transpiler took bytecode transpiled ovm safe bytecode basically bytecode make restricted syscalls added calls hypervisor transpiler line mess hard hard trying like kind like deconstruct bytecode change things reconstruct mean soon hear like well change compiler right first place build bytecode compiler yeah know asked much wanted course measured dollars million well okay yeah wrote compiler yeah modified wrote line diff compiler open source look yeah yeah looked code last night cute yeah exactly cute good word asked able said got think right break apart little bit process one thinking two right know people working amused said really mean anything okay mean deep profound insights draw like problem solve always say like want good programmer years yeah shortcuts thoughts crypto general parts technically philosophically find especially beautiful maybe oh extremely bullish crypto specific crypto project idea well two ideas one nakamoto consensus algorithm think one greatest innovations st century idea people reach consensus reach group consensus using relatively straightforward algorithm wild like mean satoshi nakamoto people always ask look like whoever think elon musk definitely think elon musk yeah idea groups reaching consensus decentralized yet formulaic way one extremely powerful idea crypto maybe second idea idea smart contracts write contract two parties contract contract disputes interpreted lawyers lawyers really shitty overpaid interpreters imagine let talk terms like let compare lawyer python right lawyer well okay brilliant never thought way hilarious python paying even cents hour use nice azure machine run python cents hour lawyers cost hour python x better axis lawyers always return answer python almost always cost yeah mean cost reliability everything python much better lawyers make smart contracts whole concept code law love would love live world everybody accepted fact maybe talk smart contracts let say let say know even something simple safety deposit box right safety deposit box holds million dollars contract bank says two three parties must present open safety deposit box get money contract bank good bank lawyers right let say know somebody dies oh going go big legal dispute whether oh well messy cost determine truth expensive versus smart contract uses cryptography check two three keys present well look certainty answer going return businesses want certainty know say businesses care viacom youtube youtube like look care way lawsuit goes please tell us certainty wonder many agreements book talking financial transactions case correct smart smart contracts oh go go anything go put prenup theory blockchain married smart contracts sorry divorce lawyer sorry going replaced python okay uh another beautiful idea think something appealing one specific implementation look years line see like bitcoin ethereum hundreds cryptocurrencies winning like intuition space sitting back watching chaos look cares emerges oh speculate really care really care one projects wins kind bitcoin meme coin camp mean bitcoin value technically kind know great like block size debate found block size debate like guys kidding block size debate know really stupid even talk people look like wow know ethereum seems governance ethereum seems much better come around bit proof stake ideas know smart people thinking things yeah know governance interesting feel like vitalik like feel like open even distributed systems leaders helpful kind help drive mission vision put face project weird thing us humans leaders helpful like vitalik right yeah brilliant leaders necessarily yeah think reason face ethereum genius interesting mean interesting think need create systems quote unquote leaders emerge geniuses system mean arguably current state democracy broken people emerging leaders competent superstars system seems like least crypto world oftentimes leaders superstars imagine debate asked sixth amendment four fundamental forces universe integral two x yeah love see questions asked want leader little bit baseball yeah mean even oh wow hurting brain standard even lower would loved see basic brilliance like talked historians even like phd even education history like dan carlin type character like holy shit information get head able connect genghis khan entirety history th century know everything every single battle happened know game thrones different power plays happened know like individuals documents involved integrate regular life like ultra history nerds know information competence looks like yeah cause seen programmers great programmers yeah would really unfortunate kinds people emerging leaders least crypto world seems case know always could imagine hundred years case crypto world one powerful idea going idea forks mean know imagine use less controversial example actually joke app like barack obama mitt romney let let president right like imagine could fork america let president americas could compete know people could invest one pull liquidity one put crypto world ethereum forks ethereum ethereum classic pull liquidity one put another people vote dollars forks companies able fork love fork nvidia know yeah like different business strategies try see see works like even take yeah take comma ai closes source take one open source see works take one purchased gm one remains android renegade different versions see beauty comma ai someone actually yeah please take comma ai fork right beauty open source mean talk autonomous vehicle space seem really knowledgeable lot different topics natural question bunch people ask keep learning new things like practical advice introspect like taking notes allocate time mess around allow curiosity drive write people book charge write write cover book advice completely meaningless going sucker buy book anyway one lesson hope take away book ca give meaningful answer interesting let translate really thought systematically could reduce people mean met brilliant people mean really clear athletes know best world something zero interest writing self like book master game athletes become great coaches love analysis perhaps analysis right least age interesting middle battle like warriors zero interest writing books middle battle yeah fair point think certain aversion kind deliberate intentional way living life eventually hilarity especially since recorded revealed beautifully absurdity finally publish book guarantee story comma ai would maybe biography written better guess might able learn cute lessons starting company like comma ai book asking generic questions like good things dude know well learn mean interesting lot lot interesting thing learning things outside current trajectory feels like outsider perspective mean uh know know advice interesting curiosity become really busy running company yeah like natural inclination trend like momentum life carries particular direction wanting focus kind dispersion curiosity lead gets harder harder time get really good certain things sucks trying things good like trying figure mean life streams fly figuring stuff mind looking dumb nah figured figured pretty quickly sometimes try things figure chest rating like despite putting like couple hundred hours pathetic mean fair know could better better like play know play five minute games play minute games least like know things stick nicely knowledge tree right let talk comma ai mission company let like look biggest picture oh exact statement solve cars delivering shippable intermediaries vision fully autonomous vehicles make sure making money along way think really speak money talk talk solve cars means solve cars course means building new car building person replacement person sit driver seat drive anywhere person drive human better level safety speed quality comfort second part delivering shippable intermediaries well way fund company true also way keep us honest easy technology think making progress heard best described hacker news set arbitrary milestone meet milestone still infinitely far away solving cars hard like real deadlines like cruz waymo revenue mean revenue essentially thing talking revenue capitalism based around consent capitalism way get revenue real capitalism commas real capitalism camp definitely scams real capitalism based around consent based around idea like getting revenue providing least much value another person someone buys thousand dollar comma two us providing least thousand dollars value would buy right give whirlwind overview products kamaei provides like throughout history today mean yeah past ones really interesting kind refinement idea real product sell today kama piece hardware cameras kama mean think kind like person know future hardware probably even person like know eyes ears mouth brain way interface car consciousness kidding trick question consciousness either kama little compute like compute efficient energy wise compute far efficient energy wise pay flops wants crazy lack consciousness sure fear death want immortality course fear death kamai fear death think course much fears well fears negative loss oh yeah okay kama come year ago two early year wow time feels like yeah feels like taken years get end long year long year sexiest thing kama feature wise mean maybe also linger like like purpose hardware software component mentioned sensors also like features capabilities think slogan summarizes well kama slogan make driving chill love okay yeah mean know like cruise control imagine cruise control much much adaptive cruise control things like slow cars front maintain certain speed also lane keeping staying lane better better better time much machine learning based cameras driver facing camera else thinking hardware versus software open pilot versus actual hardware device draw distinction one mean hardware pretty much cell phone additions cell phone cooling system car interface connected cell phone mean like qualcomm snapdragon yeah current hardware snapdragon wifi radio lte radio screen use every part cell phone interface car specific car keep supporting cars yeah interface car mean device four buses four interfaces connected usb port phone yeah four buses connect car little harness cars actually surprisingly similar protocol cars communicate able read stuff write stuff able control car depending car software side open pilot mean open pilot hardware pretty simple compared open pilot open pilot well machine learning model open pilot blob blob weights like people like oh closed source like blob weights expect primarily neural network based well open pilot software kind around neural network neural network says want send car open pilot actually goes executes cleans input neural network cleans output executes glue connects everything together runs sensors bunch calibration neural network deals like car banked road counter steer neural network ca necessarily know looking picture sensors infusion localizer open pilot also responsible sending data servers learn logging recording running cameras thermally managing device managing disk space device managing resources device since last spoke remember maybe year ago maybe little bit longer open pilot improved exactly promised promised end year able remove lanes lateral policy almost completely end end turn lanes drive slightly worse highway turn lanes turn lanes drive well trained completely end end user data year hope longitudinal policy interesting thing appear correct appear lane detection lane marking detection kind segmentation task kind object detection task traditionally called like end end learning trained actual behavior drivers driving car manually hard know supervised learning yeah nice thing lot data hard easy right lot high quality data yeah like need sense well way way data need mean interesting question actually terms amount need know driving full edge cases select data train think interesting open question like cleverest way select data question tesla probably working mean entirety machine learning seem really care kind select data feel like want solve want create intelligent systems pick data well right would hints ideas well ways definition like reinforcement learning versus supervised learning supervised learning weights depend data right obviously true reinforcement learning data depends weights yeah right actually ways poetry brilliant know data train well let pick yet eventual thinking almost like reinforcement learning framework going rl world every time car makes mistake user disengages train rl world ship new model epoch right elon style promising going fully autonomous really sticking level two like supposed supervised oh definitely supposed supervised enforce fact supervised look rate improvement disengagements openpilot unplanned disengagement every hundred miles miles like maybe maybe year ago yeah maybe seen x improvement year hundred miles still far cry hundred thousand going need going somehow need get three xs intuition basically hoping exponential improvement built baked cake somewhere well even mean x improvement already assuming exponential right definitely exponential improvement think elon talks exponential like things systems going exponentially improve exponential mean getting hundred gigahertz processors tomorrow right going still take gap even best system humans still large interesting distinction draw look way tesla approaching problem way approaching problem different rest car world let put aside treating driving tasks machine learning problem way tesla approaching multitask learning break task driving hundreds different tasks neural network good performing task presumably something top stitching stuff together order make control decisions policy decisions move car allows brilliance allows master task like lane detection stop sign detection traffic light detection drivable area segmentation vehicle bicycle pedestrian detection localization tasks also predicting entities scene going move everything basically machine learning task whether classification segmentation prediction nice entire engine data engine mining edge cases one tasks people like engineers basically masters task become best person world talk cone guy waymo yeah good old cone guy become best person world cone detection compelling notion supervised learning perspective automating much process edge case discovery retraining neural network individual perception tasks looking machine learning holistic way basically end end learning driving task supervised trained data actual driving people use ai like actual human drivers manual control plus moments disengagement maybe labeling could indicate failure system huge amount data positive control vehicle like successful control vehicle maintaining lane think also working longitudinal control vehicle failure cases vehicle something wrong needs disengagement like think right tesla wrong think think come around tesla way think tesla come around way start chess engine company would hire bishop guy see monday morning quarterbacking yes probably rook guy oh stole rook guy company oh going real good rooks well many pieces right many guys gals hire work bishop work rook ludicrous today think world alphazero alphazero chess game fundamental question hard driving compared chess end end right solution question many years away going solution level five way get sorry course tesla going come around way rook guy sorry cone guy know going specialize task going really understand rook placement yeah understand intuition mean compelling notion learn task end end like compelling notion might natural language conversation sure one thing sneaked assertion impossible get level five without kind approach know obvious know obvious either actually mean think much easier get level five end end approach think approach doable magnitude engineering challenge may exceed humanity capable think tesla data engine approach active learning task kind fascinating breaking multiple tasks mining data constantly like edge cases different tasks tasks learned feature engineering mean higher abstraction level feature engineering different tasks task engineering sense slightly better feature engineering still fundamentally feature engineering anything history ai taught us anything feature engineering approaches always replaced lose end end fair really make promises timelines say look code stockfish code alphazero one lot shorter lot elegant required lot less programmer hours write yeah lot murder bad agents alphazero side murder mean agents played game failed miserably yeah simulation failure less costly real world wait mean practice like alphazero lost games miserably seen know requirement alphazero simulator able like evolution human evolution human evolution biological evolution life earth origin life murdered trillions upon trillions organisms path us humans question stitch together object without go entire process evolution well evolution simulation yeah question simulate sense possible simulate aspect mu zero exactly mu zero solution mu zero think going looked back canonical paper think deep learning everything think still bunch things missing get mu zero think going looked back kind cornerstone paper whole deep learning era mu zero solution cars make tweaks mu zero effectively rollouts murdering learned simulator learned dynamics model interesting get enough love blown away read paper like okay always comma going sit going wait solution cars come along year saw mu zero sit back let winning roll sense elaborate little bit link topic sense neural networks solve driving yes need anything else think way chess maybe chess maybe google pinnacle search algorithms things look kind like star pinnacle era going cars path deliver products possible path full cars take decades doubt long would put like chasing tesla chasing talking five years years years yeah later part neural network well would nice see path delivering products nice l system tesla nice l system gets better every time l difference l levels takes liability liability guy want take liability going level two forever little transition mean make transition work driver sensing comes like make said hundred miles like sort human factor psychology thing people start system kinds effects gets better better better better get lazier lazier lazier like get transition right first monitoring already adaptive monitoring already seen adaptive driver monitoring camera looking driver infrared camera policy enforce driver monitoring seen adaptive mean well example one extreme cases car moving actively enforce driver monitoring going like mile hour road lights stop signs potentially pedestrians enforce tight driver monitoring policy alone perfectly straight highway machine learning none hand coded well actually stop hand coded kind machine learning estimation risk yes yeah mean always huge fan difficult every step direction worthwhile step take might difficult really well us humans able estimate risk pretty damn well whatever hell feels like one nice features us humans humans really good drivers really tuned good estimating risk supposed tuned yeah know people like oh well know would ever make driver monitoring policy less aggressive would always keep aggressive people going get fatigued yes get annoyed want want experience pleasant obviously want experience pleasant even straight safety perspective alert people look around like thing alerting nothing could possibly hit right people learn tune people learn tune put weights steering wheel whatever overcome remember always part adaptive system really say scale going forward yeah something monitor ooh know great psychology experiment scale see yeah fascinating track making sure good understanding attention key part psychology problem yeah probably come differently fascinating psychology problem explore something much deeper driving nice way explore human attention human behavior probably criticized elon musk one topic different avenues offline online little chats elon love human beings computer vision problem ai problem fascinating much interested problem order solve driving whole point want remove human picture seems like ca quite yet eventually yes ca quite yet moment ca yet say told tesla getting know seen reporting fact starting yeah ship model shadow mode believe visible light camera might even fisheye like low resolution low resolution visible light mean fair eon well last generation product one area say hardware ahead tesla rest hardware way way behind driver monitoring camera think think third row tesla podcast somewhere else heard say obviously eventually going driver monitoring think said elon definitely ship driver monitoring ships level five level five willing bet grand mean know take bet maybe someone would got money interesting bet think right actually human level made decision said driver monitoring wrong way go think human ceo think right thing say sometimes say things publicly different actually believe producing large number vehicles decision made include camera supposed say cars thing think right interesting thing side ceo mean something could probably speak leader think human publicly change mind something hard well especially assholes like george haas say told say leader happy change mind think elon yeah think come good way make psychologically okay important thing man especially first principles thinker made decision driver monitoring right way go could see decision could even make decision fence driver monitoring obvious simple solution problem attention obvious putting camera solve things create incredible compelling experience like talking know easy easy fact think creator car trying create product people love tesla tries right obvious design decision whether adding camera good idea safety perspective either human factors community everybody says obviously driver sensing driver monitoring like saying obvious parents let kids go night okay still going find ways drugs also good parents much complicated need driver monitoring totally disagree okay camera camera watching person never throws alert never think driver monitoring policy choose choose communicate user entirely separate data collection perspective one thing say tell teenager ca something another thing gather data make informed decisions really interesting make interesting thing cars even true manufacture thing car make decision anticipates right strategy start collecting data start making decisions started three years ago believe best driver monitoring solution world think compare well super cruise one really know shipped better like like super cruise mean super cruise sun would shining window would blind camera would say paying attention looking completely straight could reset attention steering wheel touch super cruise would disengage communicating car like look paying attention really going force disengage constant conversation user yeah way ship system like vucan ota shipping new one every month sometimes balance users discord sometimes make driver monitoring little aggressive people complain sometimes want aggressive possible people complain feel intrusive able update system air essential component mean probably mentioned mean biggest innovation tesla made people realize air updates essential yeah mean obvious iphone iphone first real product ota think actually brilliant mean game consoles used right game consoles maybe second thing wow really think one amazing features smartphone like touchscreen thing ability constantly update yeah gets better gets better love ios yeah well one thing probably disagree driver monitoring said easy mean tend say stuff easy sure guess said easy relative external perception problem elaborate think easy feature engineering works driver monitoring feature engineering work external human faces human faces movement human faces head body variable external environment yeah intuition yes another big difference well reliability driver monitoring system actually need high uncertainty something detecting whether human paying attention works time still getting almost benefit human like training human right dealing system really helping conversation like external thing guess swerve tree swerve tree right like get margin error yeah think really well put think right exactly place um comparing external perception control problem driver monitoring easier bar success much lower yeah still think like human face complicated actually external environment driving give damn need yeah need something need something complicated communicate idea human want communicate yo system might mess got pay attention yeah see love fascination human face feels like nice place um create products create experience car like feels like richer experiences car know like opportunity like something like eye kind system like tesla autonomous vehicle companies software much sensors much software machine learning anyway opportunity create totally new experiences even anticipating think think box gets b want chill yeah mean think soon get level three highways okay enjoy candy crush enjoy hulu enjoy know whatever whatever sure get look screens basically versus right music audio books level three kind disengage stretches time well think level three possible like highway going miles go sleep oh yeah sleep think really spectrum think able use phone highway like okay aware car might alert five seconds basically five second thing think possible yeah think oh yeah scenarios right scenarios whole risk thing mentioned nice able estimate like risky situation really important understand one thing mentioned comparing comma autopilot something haptic feel way comma controls car things uncertain like behaves little bit uncertain things uncertain kind interesting point autopilot much confident always even uncertain runs trouble funny thing actually mentioned elon think first time talked biting like communicating uncertainty guess comma really communicate uncertainty explicitly communicates haptic feel like role communicating uncertainty think stuff explicitly detect lanes highway show many lanes using drive look thinks lanes look path want better actually hiring new ui people ui people mentioned ui problem right great designer need people going build debug uis qt people qt ui done qt new ui qt qt tesla uses react stuff react js react react language right react native react native javascript framework based javascript like think dojo tesla foray appears specialized hardware training yonets guess something maybe correct shallow looking seems like something google tpus specialized driving data think specialized driving data legit tpu want go apple way basically everything required chain done well problem right one concerns really would like see somebody deal anyone like help basically two options right train options nvidia google google even option tpus available google cloud google absolutely onerous terms service restrictions may changed back google terms service said explicitly allowed use google cloud ml training autonomous vehicles anything competes google without google prior written permission well okay mean google platform company would touch tpus pole leaves monopoly nvidia nvidia fan well look huge fan nvidia jensen came sat car cool guy stock share nvidia stock skyrocketed witnessed real change management like let exploit let take every dollar possibly ecosystem let charge know got best shit game let charge really different margins making chips high mean think shooting foot business perspective lot people talking like like somebody got take nvidia yeah could dominate nvidia could new intel yeah inside everything essentially yet winners certain spaces like autonomous driving winners people like desperately falling back trying catch ton money like big automakers ones interested partnering nvidia oh think lot things going fall nvidia sell chips sell chips reasonable markup everybody everybody without restrictions without restrictions intel look intel great long run nvidia trying turn like trying productize chips way much trying extract way value sustainably sure tomorrow going share price sure one ceos like much strip mine company think know weird like ceo founder guy yeah mean still think jensen great guy great choice choice right trying cash trying buy yacht fine trying next huge semiconductor company sell chips well interesting thing jensen big vision guy plan like years road makes wonder price gouging fit yeah fit like seem make sense plan worry listening wrong people yeah makes sense sometimes despite everything think nvidia incredible company well one sort deeply grateful nvidia products created past right ti great gpu still lot yeah time feels like feels like want put stock nvidia like elon tesla autopilot dojo apple way going share dojo george hots know sell chip oh sell even accelerator accelerator cars watt one sell open make tesla car company well sell chip get yeah going make money chips take away chip going make money free money also world going build ecosystem tooling right going fix bug h layer someone else already well question interesting question mean question steve jobs asked question elon musk perhaps asking want tesla stuff inside vehicles inside potentially inside like irobot vacuum cleaner think decide advantages saying tesla start selling battery packs automakers battery packs automakers straight competition tesla keep battery technology totally far make batteries thing tesla tpu anybody build question know willing spend money could huge source revenue potentially willing spend hundred million dollars anyone build someone bunch companies starting trying build ai accelerators somebody going get idea right yeah hopefully get greedy lose next guy finally eventually chinese going make knockoff video chips perspective know also paying attention stay tesla moment well dave elon musk talked complete rewrite neural net using seems half paying attention seems involve basically kind integration sensors four dimensional view know model world time think done actually know neural network able holistic way deal world make predictions also make annotation task know easier like annotate world one place kind distributed across sensors across different like hundreds tasks involved hydronet thoughts rewrite like details kind obvious steps taken something fundamental could challenge idea end end right solution middle big view right well shipped new model bit kind going right stuff like example car pitches back lane lines also pitch back assuming flat world hypothesis new models new models output everything still annotation output zs everything zs yeah added zs added zs unified lot stuff well switched tensorflow pytorch understanding tesla thing annotator annotates across time dimension mean cute building annotator find entire pipeline find vision mean vision end end compelling also like engineering data engine created terms supervised learning pipelines thing damn impressive basically idea hundreds thousands people data collection experience kind similar kamaeai model able mine data based kind edge cases need think harder end end learning mining right edge cases feature engineering actually really powerful us humans able kind mining little better yeah obvious know obvious constraints limitations idea carpathi tweeted like get really interesting insights sort validation set loss look highest loss examples yeah little data engine like thing training segnet anyway fancy like okay train new segnet run images take thousand highest loss select human put get ones labeled retrain much less data engine yeah take things really far impressive engineering truly need supervised data problem yeah things like data engine high end attention human paying attention mean going probably build something looks like data engine push driver monitoring driving annotated beautifully human yeah interesting mean applies driver attention well want detect eyes want detect blinking pupil movement want detect face alignments landmark detection kind reasoning based want take entirety face time end end mean obvious eventually end end calibration fixes like know right move even end end actually kind supervise humans whether human paying attention completely subjective judgment try automatically stuff record video human true annotations anywhere video way get humans labeling really well know think deeply might able depending task might discover things like look steering wheel reversals something like discover little moments lapse attention psychology comes indicate much data look might able find moments inattention even smartphone want detect smartphone use start zoom gold mine comma ai tesla right annotation based learning small part entire picture challenge solving problem machine learning discover parts problem driver monitoring team half person right half person scale full two people two three people team definitely want look stuff attention let go back sec comma people curious try install comma say toyota corolla cars supported cars recommend take videos maybe words explain take actually install thing support think cars makes models got year nice yeah corolla great choice sonata using stock longitudinal using lateral control refined car longitudinal control bad yeah corolla sonata willing get hands little dirty look right places internet honda civic great going install modified eps firmware order get little bit torque ca help comma efficiently endorse ever release waited someone else discover discord server people active developer community suppose depending level experimentation willing community want buy supported car minutes install youtube videos ikea furniture level set table ikea install comma supported car work like oh want feature want fix bug okay well welcome developer community wanted something asked offline months ago wanted run code use comma platform try run something like open pilot take toggle settings called enable ssh toggle ssh device modify code upload whatever code want whole lot people people running stock comma people running forks community bunch people maintain forks forks support different cars different toggles try keep away toggles like disabled driver monitoring people might want kind thing like yeah car tell ban trying subvert safety features banned discord want anything forks got encourage responsible forking yeah yeah people know yeah people like like forks people like lot readouts ui like lot like flashing numbers forks people like fact disengages press gas pedal forks disable got stock experience like lane keeping longitudinal control altogether separate like autopilot okay cars use stock longitudinal control longitudinal control cars cars accs pretty good cars lane keep atrocious anything except autopilot super cruise know turn works engagement look like yeah mean concerned mode confusion experienced super cruise autopilot like autopilot like autopilot disengages realize acc still lead car moves slightly tesla accelerates like whatever set speed super fast like going engaged disengaged similar understanding pilot understanding either pilot control copilot control kind transition system either open pilot engaged open pilot disengaged engaged cruise control disengaged either gas brake cancel let talk money business strategy karma profitable well congratulation basically selling say karma cost thousand bucks karma two interface car well send nobody usually upfront like yeah got ta got ta add tack right love going lie trust add value life yes still super cheap days questions asked money back guarantee prices going know ever future hardware could cost lot karma three works could say future hardware going cost lot current hardware yeah people use people spoken use karma use open pilot first use lot people use fall love retention rate insane good sign yeah really good sign karma two buyers daily active users yeah amazing um also plan stopping selling karma two like like know whatever create beyond common would uh would potentially phase shift like much better like could use common use common whatever want kind four one kind yeah know autopilot hardware one versus hardware two common two kind like hardware one got got think heard talk retention rate br headsets average fast mean fascinating way think technology really really good sign thing people say commas like ca believe getting bucks right seems seems like kind steel terms like business strategies basically put currently like thousand plus cars uh yeah uh dailies uh dailies weekly monthly wow grown lot since last talked goal talk crazy second mean goal overtake tesla let talk okay mean android overtake exactly right actually know timeline one let let let talk uh cause everything alpha autopilot could argue alpha terms towards big mission autonomous driving right yeah goal overtake millions cars essentially course would stop like open source software might millions cars piece comma hardware yeah think open pilot point cross autopilot users like android crossed ios google make money android uh complicated devices make money google google makes money kind internet uh yes google search built gmail built android shill rest google ecosystem kind yeah problem andrew brilliant thing mean android arguably changed world go yes feel good ethically speaking business strategy questionable hardware hard mean took google long time come around making money pixel money winning yeah course open pilot devices come comma ai still make lot still yes ton money company ca somebody create better comma using open pilot basically saying compete well compete create better android phone google pixel right mean like know confident like know hell yeah uh uh competence merit mean money money comes consumer electronics company put way sold sold like comma twos um right uh like okay probably going sell units next year right units even thousand dollars unit okay million uh revenue um get hundred thousand maybe double price unit talking like million revenue talking actually making money one rare autonomous vehicle companies actually making money yeah know look model talking yesterday look model like testing like ab testing model one branch ab test losses go fast first five epochs yeah model probably going converge something considerably better one losses going slower people think going stop people think one day going great like well waymo eventually going surpass guys well see like world like tesla car like tesla would able basically press button like switch open pilot know load think first think may surpass tesla terms users think going surpass tesla ever terms revenue think tesla capture lot revenue per user mimics android ios model exactly may android devices know lot iphones google pixels think lot tesla cars sold pieces common hardware far tesla owner able switch open pilot ios iphones run android make sense really want really make sense like make sense cares large company like automakers gm toyota came george hots tech space amazon facebook google came large pile cash would consider purchased see one possible seriously would probably see much shit entertain willing like jump bunch hoops maybe like way works today mean approached laugh people faces like kidding yeah know demeaning people demeaning companies treat startup world innovation ecosystem think cool going along scam fake fed dollars know fed coin going fed coin know fed coin man love cool thing podcasting actually people criticize know familiar spotify giving joe rogan hundred million know know respect despite shit people talking spotify people understand podcasters like joe rogan know hell give money say like equivalent would like george hell good try murder many people like try like kind common sense things like go weird rampage yeah comes companies could respect right know could respect gm never could mean could respect like hyundai right lot closer toyota nah nah like korean way think think know japanese germans u know think great honest tech companies apple apple tech companies could respect apple closest yeah mean could never would ironic common ai acquired apple mean facebook look quit facebook years ago respect business model google declined fast last five years thoughts waymo present future let let say let start saying something nice uh visited times uh written cars engineering research actual development engineering scale actually achieving really impressive balance safety innovation like cars work really well routes drive like drive fast surprising like drives like speed limit faster speed limit goes works really damn well interface nice channel arizona yeah yeah environment know gives enough material mind push back mad men world like george hots like like cause kind imply zero probability going win yeah used written zero oh technology reasons bureaucracy worse actually product reasons think think capable creating amazing product think product building make sense things say way fast benchmark away competent uber driver right right uber driver faster even speed thing said experience stuck stop sign pedestrians crossing nonstop like uber driver come full stop stop sign know let say way slower uber right argue going cheaper argue users already choice trade money speed called uber pool think like rides uber pools right users willing trade money speed whole product building going competitive traditional ride sharing networks also whether profit made depends entirely one company monopoly think level four autonomous ride sharing vehicles market going look lot like scooter market even technology come exist question well market race bottom well could closer like uber lyft one two players well scooter people given trying market scooters practical means transportation like super fun ride look wheels love things great front actual transportation product perspective think scooters viable think level four autonomous cars viable let play fun experiment ran let tesla let waymo elon musk took vacation year said screw going go live island electronics board decides need find somebody run company decided run company year run tesla differently would change much think right track would change mean minor changes even debate tesla end end versus segnets like software cares right like going like something terrible segnets probably building something least going help debug end end system lot right easy transition like end end kind thing presume would model maybe model start adding driver sensing infrared yes would add would add infrared camera infrared lights right away cars start collecting data kind stuff yeah think already kind incredibly minor change actually ceo tesla first horrified would able better job elon would try understand way done things would also take twitter tweet yeah twitter situation quiet twitter mean says dukama like social network presence like instagram live streams understand music internet always fully engage part time used twitter yeah mean instagram pretty place instagram beautiful place glorifies beauty like instagram values network twitter glorifies conflict glorifies know like like like like like know taking shots people like know twitter donald trump perfectly perfect tesla tesla right track view yeah ok let try let really try experiment ran waymo let say know agree seem head pack kind uh would call approach like necessarily lighter based lighter robotaxi level robotaxi making revenue probably head pack said hey george please run company year would change uh would go would get anthony levandowski jail would put charge company um let try break apart want make want destroy company mean mean uh like renegade style thinking pushes like throws away bureaucracy goes first principle thinking mean think anthony levandowski genius think would come much better idea waymo mean unironically genius oh yes oh absolutely without doubt mean saying shortcomings interactions yeah um also willing take like knows would waymo mean also like far yeah big risks make going talk pockets going back forth gullible naive human like see best people slowly started realize might people like multiple faces world like deceiving dishonest still refuse like trust people care get hurt like know sometimes little bit careful especially platform wise podcast wise supposed think think think good person oh know really make moral judgments mean difficult oh mean waymo actually mean whole idea would problem putting charge waymo waymo already billion hole right idea waymo look comma profitable commas raised million small know small money like build reasonable consumer electronics company succeed wildly still never able pay back waymo billion think basic idea waymo forget billion backing basic thing like start making money well mean bigger idea like whatever ideas going save waymo going big risk idea think better person anthony lewandowski completely would ceo waymo would call transitionary ceo everything fix situation transitionary ceo yeah yeah ca right like ca ca mean talk really want apologize corny ad campaigns like real state technology yeah mean several criticisms little bit bullish waymo seem one criticism went corny mode early like still startup delivered anything like renegade show engineering impressive opposed weird commercials like friendly friendly car company mean biggest biggest snipe waymo always guy paid actor guy waymo user paid actor look found call sheet kind like spacex rocket launch get put nerds front put engineers front like show failures love love spacex yeah yeah thing right feels like right excited see succeed yeah ca wait see waymo fail know like lie want fail tell truth honest want succeed yeah yeah requires renegade ceo right still little bit faith waymo renegade ceo step forward john krafchick yeah ca chris people may good certain things renegades yeah companies fundamentally even though talking billion dollars crazy numbers still like early stage startups mean pre revenue raised billion idea like like work everything silicon valley minimum viable product know users growth numbers traditional silicon valley apply think big fail already like think autonomous driving change society mission karma solve like vision world different simple b transportation like cause robots autonomous driving technology enables think coolest applied ai problem like clear path monetary value far thing changes world mean like like cute things common like thought could stick phone windshield drive like really product building something people capable imagining years ago change world front could people imagined internet years ago true genius visionaries everyone could imagined autonomous cars years ago like car drive see sense told like dream robots deep deep connections different trajectories towards thinking thinking launching startup see autonomous vehicles potential trajectory direction would like go also see tesla even comma ai like pivoting robotics broadly defined stage way like mentioning internet expect let solve know say comma could talk let solve cars first got stay focused mission big fail however much think commas winning like winning solve level five cars know want arrogant face people great want arrogant face nature idiot right stay mission focused brilliant put like mentioned thinking launching startup considering actually covid thinking moving san francisco oh would go uh well thinking potentially austin san diego san diego come um mean interesting human launched many successful things uh san diego recommend san francisco thought case san diego qualcomm staff dragon mean amazing combination really mean qualcomm afterthought qualcomm nice thing think like tech company good one mean know like qualcomm um well san diego better stuff san francisco suck well okay first kind said like want stay california people like ocean know california flaws like lot flaws california necessarily california whole much san francisco specific yeah san francisco think first tier cities general stopped wanting growth uh well like san francisco know voting class always votes build houses houses like well know people figured vote money going insanely corrupt um balanced like political party wise know one party city discussion diversity stops lacking real diversity thought background uh approaches strategies ideas kind strange place loudest people diversity biggest lack diversity well mean say right projection projection yeah yeah interesting even people silicon valley telling uh like high people everybody like terrible place make sense mean corona virus really killed yeah san francisco number one uh exodus corona virus still think san diego good place yeah yeah mean see mean see happens california bit longer term like austin austin interesting choice would would really anything bad say austin either except extreme heat summer um like surface right think far like ecosystem goes cool personally love colorado colorado great uh yeah mean states know like way better run um california know especially san francisco tie horse like yeah ask advice others take build successful startup oh know done talk someone well know uh like another book years buy suppose um one days sell yeah right jail breaks going dollar books going uh jail broke iphone george hots right jail broke iphone days right oh god okay ca wait quite introspective built unique company mean others know um nothing interest really sat thought like well like bunch beers seeing depressed whatever struggling advice give oh mean beer yeah think like situation dependent um okay give generic piece advice technology always wins better technology always wins lying always loses build technology lie agree much long run long run sure long run remain irrational longer remain solvent true fact well interesting point ethically human believe um like like hype smoke mirrors stage company good strategy mean like know pr magic kind like know want new product call action like call action like buy new gpu look takes three slots big huge buy g yeah great look know especially ai space broadly autonomous vehicles like raise huge amount money nothing question like never part think hope willingly like something said uh essentially lying raise money like fake till make kind thing mean billy mcfarlane fire festival like experienced uh know happens fake till make honest hope make whole way technology wins right technology wins like like know slava kpss reference um hype necessarily bad loved camping iphones um know long hype backed like substance long backed something actually buy like real hype great great feeling hype backed lies bad feeling mean lot people call elon musk fraud could fraud noticed kind interesting effect tend promise deliver better way phrase promise timeline deliver delivers much later think cause think programmer thing well think really bad thing okay think long like working toward going deliver far right right like like know whole whole autonomous vehicle thing like mean still think tesla track beat us still think even even missteps advantages um know elon better like marshaling massive amounts resources know still think given fact maybe making wrong decisions end winning like fine hype actually going win right like elon says look going landing rockets back earth year takes four like know landed rocket back earth working toward whole time think amount like think becomes wrong know going meet deadline lying yeah brilliantly put like people understand think like elon believes everything says far tell detected like bullshit like conscious lying yeah think yeah ca take extreme right like way think maybe billy mcfarland believed everything said right like start cult everybody kills yeah yeah like need need like factor fine need people like know keep check like deliver things say timelines piss people though wonder cares long arc history people everybody gets pissed people succeed one things frustrates world celebrate success others like many people want elon fail fascinating like wrong like elon musk talks like people short like talk financial think much bigger financials seen like human factors community want want people fail like even people harshest thing like know even people like seem really hate donald trump want fail like president want barack obama fail like weird want would love inspire part world change human species going survive celebrate success seems like efficient thing objective function striving celebrate ones like figure like better objective function opposed like dragging back mud think speech always give commenters hacker news first something remember internet general commenters representative population comment anything know commenters representative certain sliver population hacker news common thing see see something like know promises wild innovative amount know checking back earth also amount thing succeeds well worked large tech companies whole life ca succeed succeed would mean could done something different life know could know could going fail root fail kind maintain world image tune comment well hard one things considering startup wise change think also technology problem platform problem agree like thing said people comment think people want comment assholes commenting exactly want grouped want party everyone asshole platform problem ca believe reddit become ca believe group think reddit comments reddit interesting one subreddits still see especially small subreddits little like havens like joy positivity deep even disagreement like nuanced discussion like small little pockets emergent platform helping hurting guess naturally something internet put lot effort encourage nuance positive good vibes naturally going decline chaos would love see someone well think doable think actually feel like twitter could overthrown yashobach talked like retweet positive wiring way anything like negative comment like asymmetry gives twitter particular toxicness whereas find youtube comments much better youtube comments show downloads without getting depth particular discussion point explore possibilities get lot data mean could disagree said point unclear explored really rich way like questions create platforms encourage positivity think technology problem think look back twitter maybe happen within twitter likely somebody overthrows look back twitter say ca believe put level toxicity need different business model social network fundamentally advertising business model social dilemma watch liked like know always know product nuanced take really liked said product sold influence product sold literally influence ca idea okay well know guess ca toxic yeah maybe ways spin like giving lot control user transparency see happening opposed shadows possible ca primary source users one going use depends depends think think going ca depend users another longer discussion ca depend reward like ones willing put work reward incentivize perhaps pleasantly surprised many people willing internet like real life like putting lot effort right say something stupid mean like look body language like putting effort costly introvert costly internet fuck like people like care hurts somebody care interesting yeah mean whatever think much engagement today internet disingenuine genuine think straight manipulate others whether became ad okay let talk fun topic programming another book idea let pitch perfect programming setup like george hots like listen give macbook air sit corner hotel room know still food fetishize like multiple monitors keyboard things nice going say automatically unlock tons productivity definitely productive macbook air corner hotel room ide operating system love text editor use ide something like perfect could say perfect productivity setup george hots matter matter literally matter guess code time vim literally using editor make anything better okay vs code nice reading code things nice think build much better tools like ida xrefs work way better vs codes yeah actually good question like still use sorry emacs actually never confess something dark yeah never used vim think maybe afraid life waste evangelical emacs feel tenderflow versus pytorch everything like switched everything pytorch put months switch felt like wasted years tensorflow ca believe ca believe much better pytorch yeah used emacs vim matter yeah still heart somehow fell love lisp know ca heart wants heart wants understand connected maybe functional language first connected maybe many ai courses deep learning revolution taught lisp mind know know stuck time like using modern id programming know much better used modern ids time like well disagree like like multiple monitors like work laptop pain ass also addicted kinesis weird keyboard could see yeah mac book mean look work three inch monitors happy hacking keyboard razor death header mouse like essential let go day life george hots perfect day productivity wise talking like hunter thompson drugs let look productivity like day look like like hour hour regularities create magical george hots experience remember three days life remember days vividly gone kind radical transformations way think would give would pay hundred thousand dollars could one days tomorrow days impactful one first discovering elias yudkowsky singularity reading stuff like know mind blown next discovering hunter price ai compression like finally understanding aixi know like read understand fact like lossless compression implies intelligence day shown third one controversial day found blog called unqualified reservations read like wait one guy name curtis yarvin yeah many people tell supposed talk yeah sounds insane brilliant insane know found blog another like like like gamergate kind run election like wow okay world makes sense like framework interpret like got framework ai framework interpret technological progress like days discovered new frameworks oh interesting special days days come got lucky like sure like encountered harder prize hacking news something like like see think see think like could gotten lucky point think way ready moment yeah exactly receive information magic day today like like eating breakfast mundane things nah nothing drift life without structure drift life hoping praying get another day like days nothing particular receptacle another day number four anything get ones think really anything took month long trip new york ethereum thing highlight rest pretty terrible two week road trip got turn around turn around drive gunnison colorado pass gunnison snow starts coming pass called monarch pass order get denver got get rockies turn car around could watched watched go road like got ta go back like day meaningful like like real like actually turn car around rare anything even real happens life even mundane fact yeah snow turn around stay gunnison leave next day something moment felt real okay actually interesting break apart three moments mentioned okay always trouble pronouncing name lousy yurkowski worldview change starting consider exponential growth ai agi thinks threats artificial intelligence kind ideas like like maybe break apart like exactly magical transformational experience today everyone knows threats ai safety pre stuff think mention ai safety page old yurkowski stuff probably denounce probably like exactly want happen sorry man something specific take work remember yeah realization computers double power every months humans crossed yet one thing doubling every months one thing staying like know log graph line know calculate open door exponential thinking like thinking like know technology actually transform world opened door human obsolescence opened door realize lifetime humans going replaced matching idea artificial intelligence hutter prize know torn go back forth think basic thesis nice nice compelling notion reduce task creating intelligent system generally intelligent system task compression think intelligence universe fact kind compression find time found compelling idea still find compelling idea still find compelling idea think useful day day actually one maybe quests search definition word intelligence never one definitely definition word compression simple straightforward one know compression know lossless lossless compression lossy lossless compression equivalent intelligence believe sure useful definition day day like framework understand x prize competition like recently months ago ever thought taking crack oh oh spent spent next found prize spent next six months life trying well started learning everything ai worked vicarious bit learned read deep learning stuff like okay like caught modern ai wow really good framework put compression stuff right like first first deep learning models played gbt gbt basically transformers still rnns character prediction way compression side mean especially neural networks make lossless requirement hutter prize know human intelligence neural networks probably compress stuff pretty well would lossy imperfect turn lossy compression lossless compressor pretty easily using arithmetic encoder right take arithmetic encoder encode noise maximum efficiency right even ca predict exactly next character better probability distribution put next character use arithmetic encoder right know whether e put good probabilities know code bits entropy thing right let topic could interesting little side tour thoughts year language models transformers something interesting ai researcher something interesting autonomous vehicle developer nah think think overhyped mean like cool cool going able scale get general purpose intelligence like loss function literally know know cross entropy loss character right like loss function general intelligence obvious yes imagine like play devil advocate possible achieve general intelligence something dumb kind loss function guess depends mean general intelligence another problem gpts memory right right like scaled version find hard believe well scale yeah length make wider wider wider yeah going get going get cool things systems think ever going get something like know build rocket ship know use transformer video example think something look use use gru use gru grew transformer think driving much markovian language markovian mean like memory aspect markov chains markovian mean like information state minus one also state see yeah right kind like drops nicely like whereas sometime language refer back third paragraph second page feel like many like like say like speed limit signs really many things autonomous driving look like look play devil advocate risk estimation thing talked kind interesting feels like might longer term aggregation context necessary able figure like context even sure believing devil advocate nice nice like vision model outputs like one two four dimensional perception space try transformers sure probably point try transformers see better sure might game changer well like like might transformers work better grooves autonomous driving sure might switch sure radical change okay used slightly different know switched rnns grooves like okay maybe grooves transformers yeah well topic general intelligence know much talked like um think actually build agi like look ray kurzweil singularity like intuition kind saying driving easy yeah tend personally believe solving driving really deep important impacts ability solve general intelligence like think driving require general intelligence think going neighbors way like deeply tied like driving deeply connected human experience think solving one help solve see see driving like easy almost like separate general intelligence like vision future singularity see single moment like singularity phase shift singularity like crazy ideas future terms agi definitely singularity course course look bandwidth people bandwidth people goes right um singularity know bandwidth mean bandwidth people communications tools whole world networked whole world networked raise speed network right oh think communication information distributed way empowering thing collective intelligence oh say necessarily good thing think like think definition singularity yeah seems kind right see like change world beyond like world would transformed ways ca possibly imagine mean think singularity sense like know one world monoculture also linked yeah mean kind share intuition singularity originate collective intelligence us ants versus like single system agi type thing oh totally agree yeah really believe like like hard takeoff agi kind thing um yeah think even think ai different kind already building respect driving think driving subset general intelligence think pretty complete subset think tools develop comma also extremely helpful solving general intelligence think real reason care cars cool problem beat people yeah mean yeah kind two minds one mission want focus make sure get get ca forget time thread much bigger uh connects entirety effort much bigger driving ai general intelligence easy delude thinking figured something build level five car indisputably built something yeah general intelligence going debate say built something provides huge financial value yeah beautifully put engineering credo like build thing like uh uh uh uh go mars yeah great one argue like hell cares going mars reality set mission get done yeah going crack pro problem never even expected process yeah know think choice humanity going mars solving cars think going mars uh better know suited cars information guy modernist right beautifully put let let drag back programming sec three maybe three five programming languages people learn think like look get learning uh well everybody learn c assembly start two right assembly yeah ca code assembly know computer understand like great assembly code like appreciate assembly order appreciate great things c gets code c order appreciate great things python gets say assembly c python start three memory allocation c fact assembly give sense many levels abstraction get work modern day programming yeah yeah graph coloring assignment register assignment compilers yeah like know got know compiler computer certain number registers yet variables want c function know get start build intuition compilation like compiler gets else well kind imperative programming languages two paradigms programming everybody familiar one functional learn haskell take way learn language dependent types like coq learn whole space like pl theory heavy languages haskell favorite functional yeah great haskell programmer wrote compiler haskell another paradigm actually one paradigm even talk never used talk would think next paradigm learn verilog hdl understand idea instructions executed block verilog write stuff sequential execute like think like hardware works guess assembly quite get assembly compilation verilog hardware like giving sense actually hardware assembly c python straight like sit right top fact c well c kind coded c could imagine first c coded assembly python actually coded know straight go got verilog gives brilliant okay think another one everyone carpathi calls programming learn even going learn tensorflow learn pytorch machine learning got come better term programming yeah programming language wonder formalized little bit better feels like early days actually entails data driven programming data driven programming yeah fundamentally different paradigm others like almost requires different skill set think still yeah pytorch versus tensorflow pytorch wins fourth paradigm fourth paradigm kind seen like know imperative functional hardware know better word ml advice people want know get programming want learn programming video programming new blessings exclamation point think top comment like warning noobs noob like tldw video also noob friendly advice get programming never going learn programming watching video called learn programming way learn programming think one way everyone ever met program well learned way something wanted tried like oh well okay kind know nice computer could kind thing know learn keep pushing project advice learning programming go program somebody wrote question like really looking learn recurrent neural networks saying like company thinking using recurrent neural networks time series data really idea use yet want like advice learn kind general machine learning questions think answer like actually problem trying solve see stuff oh god people talk like like heard machine learning important would help us integrate machine learning macaroni cheese production even ca help people like lets run anything lets kind person run anything think beginners point like beginner like problem know machine learning problem think machine learning something say macaroni cheese production like heard new technology use like know use true build intuition might able figure way like prerequisite macaroni cheese problem solve first exactly two traditional like learning process involve traditionally applicable problems space whatever machine learning see applied competition least start tell problem like problem like know boxes getting enough macaroni use machine learning solve problem much much better apply machine learning macaroni cheese one big thing maybe talking audience little bit get days many messages advice like learn stuff okay mean think quite profound actually google oh yeah one skills really acquire engineer researcher thinker like one two complimentary skills like one blank sheet paper internet think deeply google crap questions actually skill people often talk like research like pulling thread like looking different words going like github repositories two stars like looking stuff like looking code going twitter seeing like little pockets brilliant people like discussions like neuroscientist go signal processing community ai person going psychology community like switch communities like keep searching searching searching much better invest like finding somebody else already solved problem try solve problem often invested years life like entire communities probably already tried solve problem think thing think go try solve problem trying solve problem good solving problems stumble upon person solved already stumbling really important think skill people really put especially undergrad like search ask question get started deep learning like especially like googleable like whole point google get million pages start looking start pulling threads start exploring start taking notes start getting advice million people already like spent life answering question actually oh well yeah mean definitely also yeah people like ask things like like trust top answer google much much better anything going tell right yeah people ask interesting question let know recommendations three books technical fiction philosophical impact life would recommend perhaps maybe start least controversial infinite jest infinite jest david foster wallace yeah book wireheading really enjoyable read well written grow person reading book effort set second book pornography called atlas shrugged atlas shrugged pornography yeah mean defend say atlas shrugged book entertaining read certainly like pornography production value great page monologue anne rand editor really wanted take paid paid pocket keep page monologue book great book kind framework human relations know lot people like yeah terrible framework yeah framework context couple days speaking probably four plus hours yaron brook main living remaining objectivist objectivist interesting always found philosophy quite interesting many levels one repulsive percent large percent population find always funny people like unable even read philosophy think says psychological perspective something objectivism anne rand philosophy deeply connected idea capitalism ethical life productive life always compelling seem interpret negative sense people fair read book impact point yeah bad guys book slogan according ability according need looking like team rocket level cartoonishness right bad realized actually slogan communist party like wait second wait telling really happened yeah interesting mean one criticisms work cartoonish view good evil like reality jordan peterson says us capacity good evil us opposed like characters purely evil characters purely good way pornographic production value love like evil punished clear like know know like porn know like character growth well know neither alan sherwood like really well put year old george hotz good enough yeah yeah third something could give two throw perputation city great thing start thinking copies um uh greg egan uh might real name australian guy might australian know um one online called metamorphosis prime intellect um story set world interesting uh either worlds find something uh philosophically interesting comment mean clear uh metamorphosis prime intellect like written engineer uh almost pragmatic take utopia way positive negative well decide reading book ending interesting well realize first read reread book several times life short pages everyone go read uh sorry little tangent working foundation read much whole life trying fix uh last months little side project uh greatest novel uh uh people read mean would would yeah would would say like yeah permutation city metamorphosis primal intellect um know like foundation uh thought way modernist um like dune like never read dune never read dune read uh fire upon deep interesting uh okay mean look everyone read everyone read neuromancer everyone read snow crash read like start um yeah read snow crash never read snow crash oh entertaining go lester bach want controversial one bronze age mindset right look one around books bunch people asked twitter reddit advice advice would give young person today life another uh yeah mean looking back especially young person younger uh continued accomplished lot interesting things advice life pass college ever opens would love give graduation speech um point put lot somewhat satirical effort question yeah written anything point oh know sunscreen water like plagiarizing mean like clean room know play drugs stuff books designed help designed make feel good like whatever advice could give already know everyone already knows sorry feel good right like know know tell know eat well read going anything think whole like genre kinds questions meaningless know anything worry much stuff caught head right mean yeah sense whole life whole existence like moving version advice know something mean something resists kind thinking illustrative something learn think clearly overthinking stuff yeah know even talk advice like advice relevant relevant anybody else saying go kind person overthinks things stop overthinking things bad work maybe works know know let ask love yeah uh think last time talked meaning life kind winning course uh think talked love much whether romantic love common humanity amongst us role love played life quest winning love fit well word love think means uh several different things uh love sense maybe could say like love sense opiates love sense uh oxytocin love sense maybe like love math think fits either first two paradigms uh uh given something life big fan first two um reason fan know reason opiates take ecstasy right times look tried um like opiates way like ecstasy uh ethical life productive life maybe problem like yeah sense know like abstract love humanity mean abstract love humanity like yeah always felt guess hard imagine feeling maybe people know yeah like background thing mean since brought drugs let ask

opinion role journalism also germany role journalists intellectuals time trouble brewing requires really sort brave deep thinking understand trouble brewing journalist like intellectual thinker also voice space public discourse would stalin hotham would nazi germany really funny asked currently book structured like know books often follow three act structure right act three eighties act one thirties act two going like right let suppose thirties going give like going like well screwed right say things going bad long time going one like going something know going go swinging two books recommend masterpieces written women historians superb book called beyond belief deborah lipschad talks rise nazi germany seen press amazing great job empathizing press understand perspective remember chamberlain gets bad rap neville chamberlain kind appeasing hitler long ago great war world war one carnage earth never seen people made meat meat industrial machines plastic surgery invented consequence coming back mangled disfigured world kaiser evil person ever lived western propaganda han rapes barbarism blah blah blah long later hearing propaganda factual hitler like heard heard years ago lies give us break quotes different agencies addressed plus limited information like nazi germany open society reporters walk around lot pressure well areas hitler pretty good lets stuff slip usually made seem like wants peace wants world peace amazing making argument jews beaten street proved hot take day hitler weak since hitler statesman ca control hooligans shows control power tenuous going go away way mean hitler thought kind afraid bronchers whatever afraid hooligans little bit useful like certain point like yeah get way wanted get control military army like regiment like want

superb essay think eugene genovese talks question question know know know concentration camps know starvation know children taught school turn parents extra bread conclusion knew knew beginning every bit care interested promoting ideology people kind thinking worst thing earth like robert lee statue taken washington dc told especially much limited news information world literally anyone twitter many outlets backwards future scientific vagaries market led great depression see put american public time anyone thinks things bad ever simply delusional ignorant yeah would say small aside reading almost done rise fall third reich refreshes resets palette understanding good evil world think really useful helps really positive almost naive twitter world studying history comparing amazing things today time would brave mind acts bravery effective something often think sometimes easy activist terms saying stuff hard effective activism one big questions historians constantly happen make sure happen germany kind weirdo cult nation advanced land poets philosophers get point shooting children everyone cheering specifically antisemitism holocaust totalitarianism cult hitler whole thing sorry interrupt two sides know want separate one totalitarianism entirety nazi regime holocaust going would say specifically think describe targeting jews much know see two separate things think interconnected think look everyone thinks ones putting anne frank look numbers ones calling stasi whoever people time stasi obviously patting back sorry pause really important thing listening germany time would likely willing commit least keep blind eye violence jews really sit idea would somebody sees bothered also likely kind understand necessary evil even necessary good yeah think people think would abolitionists marching selma numbers add think question would like social friend tinder friend matt great dude question controversial opinion new york girl wrote hate trump people perceive courageous saying actual social costs saying two disconnected things also trained corporate media completely vapid uninteresting banal ideas yet regard revolutionaries people still new york take pride gay friend like first cares second hero person prop way another big problem like give richard wolff shout intellectual talks communism think takes kind heroic intellectual right speak communism seriously difficult waters tread expression difficult paths walk love watching robot try use idiom language know quite deeply hurt binary comment feeling gone one zero yeah love powers overflown difficult feel like communism universally seen bad thing currently intellectual circles yes actually maybe people disagree people say far left people trying people argue blm movement kind arm marxist really follow deep logic whatever said formed marxism founder stating different marx totalitarian also marx revolutionary think talking like revolutionaries going overthrow status quo yeah right discussion think speak deeply political systems saying communism going righteous system deep intellectual discourse mean try stage jordan peterson brave thing would argue communism interesting see many people certainly would willing enough first believe second difficult argument make would get much fire like richard wolff one people quite rigorously showing good ideas within system communism specifically saying attacking negative sides capitalism saying capitalism potentially dangerous communism mean disagree think love something like got body count million everything potentially know like water drown everyone earth incoherent well think nuclear weapons bad nuclear energy good sure nuclear weapons also good easily make argument know subscribe nuclear weapons prevented boots ground war cost much contained know also quite effective changing direction asteroid hit earth learned armageddon armageddon actually useful elon musk claimed application prior colonizing mars making

jeanette rankin first woman elected congress elected women suffrage passed constitutional amendment montana elected one handful people vote us going great war right call time pacifist republican well coincidentally lost seat ran got seat person vote getting world war ii unanimous choice jeanette rankin one person said could win war win hurricane one interesting talk bravery one vote pearl harbor say mean pressure must time course many people interested hearing prospecto crazy evil blah blah also funny someone twitter talked goes maybe hitler sympathies like yeah rankin big fan hitler figured guys think argument made united states gotten involved world war ii oh easy easy argument argument talk new right internet circles something called godwin law means longer internet conversation goes probability someone gets compared hitler becomes one certain new right circles longer conversation goes likelihood argument become ended world war ii also becomes one argument least stay back let hitler stalin kill go knock weaker one going saving destroying two nightmare systems think easy argument make hard pull pearl harbor terms strategy think tough sell pearl harbor mean saying pearl harbor going sell people argument blah blah holocaust holocaust scenario happen really unless going way earlier even hitler said jews launched another war going wipe face earth jews held hostage hitler argument another thing diabolical order make people could accept jews refugees going leave germany penniless like coming money take care going completely destitute makes harder accept yeah millions destitute people speak language tough sell speaking goodwin law make condition trump derangement syndrome idea comparing trump hitler think despicable give something parallel think people regarding despicable earlier told unless syria immediately kurds going exterminated invoke holocaust going another genocide basically forcing another holocaust none people used argument go syria kurds exterminated vanished news consequences using kind comparison think really kind fatuous think amazing people think hitler tyrant ever lived like everyone bad specifically hitler know know hitler tweet one comes house kill family kind big difference also difference trump many critics grandchildren raised jews also kind deborah lipschad talks lot new york times time another book called buried times talks new york times world war ii idea jews white hitler idea new york times time salzburger wanted idea specifically downplayed opposed nazis oppressive argument separate nazism historical debate people perspective find convincing separate two think essential nazism think nazism mussolini fascism big differences think fundamental hitler interesting thing like tool saw effective believed see intricately connected could hitler accomplished amount without holocaust yeah think many resources divert time operation barbarossa stalin connected hitler insane bad strategist obviously bad strategist need open second front generals understanding told crazy work draw russia resources war makes absolutely sense retrospect book forget called talked point high time amphetamines could affected thinking yeah really good book drugs forget called yeah really good one mean scapegoating big part parcel nazi mythology kind one universal figure explain kind skeleton key could communists could source hatred communists get germany world war like said jews seems atrocity holocaust reason see hitler evil reason see hitler evil world war ii propaganda still see stalin evil right main point see mao evil extent think would say know nature propaganda nature problem certain type mentality hitler mass murder equally long killing one group problem murdering everyone equally sudden like going fact like saying hall common knowledge fact mao million dead common knowledge richard nixon raising glass china things think west done good job reconciling knock knock frank frank frank friend michael heart attacks say frank friend got like right yeah okay back hitler think hitler could stopped kind talked little bit terms brave thing time nazi germany think mean even going ask stalin terms could stalin stopped probably answer hitler side could hitler stopped think lot things lot luck play almost assassinated mean like west hard mean yeah german people mean like politically speaking rise power thirties twenties really mean like whoever hitler kind way thinking totalitarian control always leads trouble sometimes mass scale could stopped germany maybe soviet union well think one best arguments radicalization states engage like population members party dedicated systemically overthrowing existing democracy stalin gave orders communists pretty sizable population reichstag target nazis liberals social democrats invented term social fascist instead like jihadis instead taking sights nazism set sights moderates figured choice hitler us going win huge gamble killed flee ones fled killed also stalin understanding easy way could certainly heavily mitigated france england obvious hitler lying wanted peace bad willing put even czechoslovakia argument like threatened military force argument going remember barack obama red line cross red line syria going go assad whatever like yeah cool like oh okay well sorry threatening force great song lyric show guns unless intend fight clear free countries press whether institutional follow threats think hard chamberlain rally british people take hitler great mean suffering britain took great war still know obviously means much us west

write kind book one book kind reading could beach bathroom going get entire history know everything need know north korea one accessible outlet people appreciate north korea several things bad happen overnight systemic family country piece piece everything power hermetically seal rest world ramp oppression keep information coming creative innovative style manipulation control farcical element let give example people west kind get wrong talk oh talk kim played golf first time get holes one one story kim shrinking time story sounds supernatural kim conference dear leader someone giving talk person giving talk kim taking notes working work aide keeps interrupting questions speaker keeps stopping kim says stopping goes things everyone shocked said kim looks time like plane like cube shrink

standing crying courage ask thing one power like listen quite confident funfair engineers position ride modest mouse whatever called like yeah okay good kids although fair amusement parks pretty rusty dangerous kind propaganda guess playing devil advocate like comforting useful seem naturally leads abuse power used correctly one person intellect mind understand entirety economy let alone every individual field interest well example artificial intelligence system understands entirety affect completely changed mask slipped yes could artificial intelligence system like question mean like human version like hire lot experts right extremely good manager since everything dynamic going data kind manage well seems like george washington allegedly seems like humans able fire able like ultimately check power like creating human like obvious bug system would able fire know seems like something know always like something often wonder like wrong well talked earlier safety valves make sure okay

speak english work family royalty things like lot fun questions kind going choose one well really good job like ben shapiro good job trolley side humor side tear power structures also serious side safe space people walks life walk adversarial never take word guests seriously going show going negative consequences result show said mean maybe case honest say find alex jones outside conspiracy stuff reason maybe explain maybe psychonalyze find hilarious yeah listen performer performative lot people see humor see serious consequences spreading conspiracy theories different kinds see danger personally often tempted talk alex podcast format think trying convince never feel unsafe talking alex ca truly like naive honest actually generally talk humans want see best think like often think talked hitler got list names give well yeah mean get interview come let honest kidding would give away one would probably give away brother many brothers one okay many want child older brother used pick payback know good life think stalin sorry interrupt hitler jewish already going adversarial going normal going perceive human sense right stalin right yeah would much easier kim something like okay think okay good question jot something alex loves hitler right cross second think really good example difficult figure controversial people bring lot interviewed twice curtis yarvin yeah mentis molleblug mentis molle aka mentis molleblug pseudonym goes blog tell sure interesting ideas interesting well briefly invented concept red pill mentis molleblug blog called unqualified reservations still find online verbose writes length bright perspective heretical lot things take granted liberal democracy regards incorrect downright absurd take many people view basis american political discourse basis thought starting someone basically repudiating kind western worldview western worldview like american milieu lot people going course regard dangerous someone verboten bright person toxic figure guardians acceptable discourse make sure forts secured figure outside acceptable discourse marginalized regarded radioactive possible want let kind ideas would destructive hegemony well let dig like read things hear bunch places called racist white supremacist go wikipedia yeah view race section let read okay jarvan opinions described racist writings interpreted supportive slavery including belief whites higher iqs blacks genetic reasons jarvan maintains racist doubts quote races equally smart notion quote people score higher iq tests sense superior human beings quote creepy also disputes outspoken advocate slavery though argued races suited slavery others quote obvious although white nationalist exactly allergic stuff jarvan wrote post linked approvingly know people steve saylor steve saylor yeah jared taylor racialists yeah okay like one questions let say one sentence way mentioned guy earlier defending aspects communism contexts acceptable think like radioactive fact engaging ideas anything reputed costs renders large extent racist really interesting topics nuanced nuanced communism still topic nuanced difficult race like talking slavery iq differences based race topic guess radioactive degree ca even say anything even like nuanced even like making point like touching make another point understandably understand going steal man point understand point like talking hitler foot gets door people inherently slaves people inherently better others really quickly collapses would perspective like give criticism let say one thing racist also used describe alex jones sex talk race racist shorthand certain percentage population let know bother investing person limits definitely racism sexism thing used shut conversation quite absurd small percent population jared taylor steve saylor jared taylor interviewed book would regarded sense racist difference racist racialists racialists mean splitting hairs going radioactive jared taylor runs something called amren mean perspective inherent differences races live side side well whites blacks living side side way people know context written great book includes concepts called new right includes concepts talks include yeah growth community around kinds worlds right point iq like population dutch right think tallest people earth said well dutch best people earth tallest like crazy person someone scoring low individual iq test means somehow lower quality person well maybe one specific aspect mean good human got friends low iq friends low iq frankly compared sound like trump second well choices one going level well smartest person since abraham lincoln ever seen unlike actually honest someone much swims heretical ideas another thing bring aristotle said people born slaves speaking race meant people souls mencken great heretic early th century figure one quotes say time people seen lot past year average man want free merely wants safe think know familiar mulderberg saying slavery writing ponderous certainly something think undeniable think people realizing large percent population actively disinterested freedom moral responsibilities entails well mean really word slavery want make kind point even think topic outside context horrible thing happened united states countries history unique us let clear mean important slavery going today lot people argue sex trafficking kinds things mean atrocities going today talking way immediately saying horrible thing happened ever something think lot like want say something controversial skill care things care well would disagree say things often say things controversial say uncontroversial things controversial way useful mechanism alienate people want around people going shocked certain topics like ended world war ii like even hypothesis clutch pearls like oh want holocaust happen ca discuss things interested conversation interested emotional response yeah think see things differently maybe bit devil advocate least modern discourse like twitter social media find actually removing people thoughtful kind actually attracting loud people like small number come start yelling start yelling basically ruin party showing screaming thoughtful people leave well heavy blocker block people twitter cultivate audience like lot times people come care start attacking members audience like dang got block one ca yeah know unnecessarily provoking people feels beta testing try break system see works put much pressure possible much computer stuff able appreciate point program trying intentionally sit many mistakes see go wrong right common practice yeah saying way see communication world say something uncontroversial controversial way blocks people trigger roll eyes going emotional response going start yelling problem reason ca think like ca sure points trying make always always sure right things thoughtful afraid turn ineliquently phrased even incorrect statement damage ca undone terms good conversation topic want careful saying afraid fear talking think fear saying something fears core many problems world today saying say stuff care going touch race topic feels like really deeply first point make really care point want make second think deeply say point way communicates best touching would say listen show great like say thank menchus mobug welcome name show thank couple times great get loose way talk different kinds stuff think talked race bringing back asking read wikipedia perspective going guy talks slavery constantly completely disproportionate work even show tell even outside race stuff ultra careful nuanced yeah afraid say something like would say let criticize think carelessly say something controversial right saying go makes different thing somebody purpose says something controversial stuff like milo anopoulos sorry forgot milo whatever name yeah really nice see genuine person thoughtful mean carelessly seems say things feel like damaged rest body work ca really speak would guess point swimming kind worldview going anathema already pleasing people bother trying think deeply black pill way seeing world black pill cynical way like people saying kind way thinking say whatever want whoever comes along earlier said racism weaponized way shut conversation think perspective would outside mainstream worldview know going called racist point trying nuanced already going get scarlet ear yeah disagree example one person turned carelessness think good target somebody think fair convenient think ridiculous people call everybody racist sexist currently ca please even going try gray area people listen outrage culture whatever wikipedia article means nothing going right got seeing careless person going careless race like feel like walk along long enough going catch carelessness going lose defend perspective better good taking notes talked eric weinstein guys talked show know weinstein good conversation invited show would amazing conversation got phone concern fairly goes want come show purposes clowning would never might aware wanted feel like hears troll mean lot different things conversation clear conversation would go think going someone show responsibility going pay cost guest put live stream two understand coming think bright different audience going something different sense would feel safe yeah would feel safe born alive would like actually talk one day alex jones crossed line well could could tape episode never released one things finally make history channel documentary went wrong cult started everybody killed release unseen footage started black white basement somewhere new york yeah mother basement explains much okay spoke yaron brook objectivism ayn rand kind argued highlighted difference capitalism anarchism around topic violence government sort negative way say like monopoly violence basically arbiter people making sure violence get hand yeah showed yeah government great yep well okay without straight face making argument good work yaron right well straight face argue idea anarchism violence would get hand sure one thing worst argument one little quotes presented strongest arguments anarchism inevitably descriptions stras quo argument anarchism warlords killing people whoever strongest gets take neighborhood well saw police perfectly comfortable disarming population try protect punished happy stand happen monopoly let suppose television stations right cbs said know going broadcast cool broadcast going watch channels problem monopoly everyone dependent issue amazing monarchism objectivists argue government really really bad everything touches therefore charge important stuff well therefore thing fundamentally different things garon brook also said government ever show ever worked way proposing objectivism ayn rand philosophy based objective reality posited look study facts nature facts reality deduce things accordingly much regards part aristotelian tradition opposed platonist tradition idea precedes reality idea real see around us saying data according contradicts argument still going make imaginary government never existed evidence exist let talk objective law access legal system something want even terms selling disputes government monopoly going expensive difficult poor people cost hiring lawyer expensive hiring surgeon ca say straight face way best way thing argument objectivism stupid anarchism stupid claim like member one security company member another company dispute one shows door happens insuperable argument well earth every country state anarchism regarding every country world government happens canadian kills american mexico idea bet idea sure system worked ahead time three countries worked way reinvent wheel thing cell phone companies sprint metropcs call pays sprint pay split difference first objective way one work thing companies auto accidents arbitrage time like run work never reaches desk thing cops good keeping people government monopoly forcing people customers keeping unsafe okay things like say explore ideas one terms canadian mexico something worked perhaps perhaps say perhaps know sure point trying make let say sure worked point history worked work come place stability first instability first every kind situation dispute space like gets mars kind thing first different competing institutions figure concern anarchism think kind interaction said brilliantly anarchism relative one world government right alex jones enters chat fear going instability converge towards stable place fear goal ayn rand philosophy let something always talk creatively destructive means look something happening long time every generation every innovator starts chipping away finds better ways marginal improvement marginal work goes broke government tries implement improvement suffer consequences innovator huge asymmetry hurts hurts succeeds becomes rich profit consequence fear anarchism think destruction destruction right like instability let give stability one words sounds objective real meaning field stability let suppose want stability relationships yeah let talk medicine medicine means going invent new diseases new treatments right mean stability terms baseline security already relationships turn violent anarchist system look right look bar full drunken young males full testosterone look hotel everyone native area far safer places government taken upon protect parks alleyways streets subways right comparison better keeping people safe obvious something private someone control would layers police would government monopoly store would someone street would someone personal security would attached phone security function geography opposed function individual landline technology phone world think possible psychologically speaking individual among masses sense security even though centralized thing bottom whole thing set laws enforced based geography like nations set laws enforced kind emergent agreed upon way basically want go hotel trust able get room nobody going break door know take vodka let take different way worried hotel bed bugs something government involved mechanism unrealistic concern mechanisms right undertake make sure case yes would thing want make sure go hotel security would exactly thing another example kosher food people keep kosher juice keep kosher food prepared certain way meet higher rabbinical standards right look food certification k even competition k stricter u letter people notice looking would companies certifying different locales level security would take hour app would like toll roads right would tell approaching unsafe area going covered us could color coded easily could today thing exactly correct assumption already okay give different word stability already place forces market whatever operate worry like initially might enough stability choose one place versus based security provide already different types security federal government state governments local governments often contradict idea implausibility different security companies unstable impossible already rough example happening real life started like idea especially yaron like started government monopoly violence saying like kids let violence get hand civil war half country slaughtered display government monopoly violence right monopoly violence north could draft people fight others even care south government splitting okay like giant iceberg splitting argument would something like civil war much often anarchism first civil war much often car companies right car company says refuse pay whatever violence arjun trump playing advocate hold let finish violence company saying cars run consequences rough analog happened terms security system free like switching cell phone go one provider another one company part payment want month month wants son going member security company unless case dealing something like pearl harbor foreign invasion hands deck let go evidence many places evidence large scale well actually large scale feels like know person ebay ebay example anarchism practice selling something someone whose name even know country nowhere approximate ebay acts arbiter sometimes get money get screwed far less taxation give federal government great point space finance could ebay could also commit violence theft violence yeah give grand car deliver anything stolen grand yes something uniquely problematic stabbed shot reason stabbed shot government despite contract refusing allow second amendment rights implemented among citizenry people making case cops ones traitors constitution regarded whereas private companies far amenable market pressures state strong argument let actually briefly mention scale thing think talk scale anarchism vermont brooklyn fine people make argument need anarchism else china going invade like saying little countries exist san salvador exist violent point moment notice invaded kuwait example invaded iraq quickly big countries interested stability safe space got involved kicked kuwait company waging war population seems quite likely organization would get together put stop position provide services security customers okay brilliant say actually state anarchism relative countries yes emerges actually living state anarchism agreed agreed anything like basic criticism like born land geographical land geographical area forced signed bunch stuff born particular place really could much easier choose space ideas associated would actually state anarchism yes could like military sign sure certainly putting people prison get raped selling drugs yeah certainly allowing everyone else street wants say something nice ayn rand talk nice things day copy fountainhead unit ayn rand best idea one find impactful insightful useful us modern society think life meaning productive work highest value apologize something despise apologize saying want happy going work toward others owe nobody else random stranger second time see lot twitter social media people like demanding debate demanding act certain way engage owe anything think best ideas teaches think ayn rand answers questions think think whole selfishness thing mean triggered word selfishness really unfortunate talking earlier mold bug carelessly indefensible opinion talks virtue selfishness claims people talk selfishness mean concern primarily self people talk selfishness mean sociopathic way concern exclusively oneself mean like oh someone dying street going even waste second saving selfish sets complete caricature term attacking selflessness best sense people sense self values goals everything mind gotten secondhand culture large nothing unique special perspective worth fighting advocates self basically means achievement think word choice really false needlessly controversial perhaps purpose controversial know accurate people mean selfishness yeah would say one reasons probably philosophy much adopted thought funny use words means something exactly said criticism mentioned small bug could incorrect criticism way exactly sure talk modern day chaos politics yes please hate chaos speaking hatred chaos let talk secession oh yeah first one trip yeah well civil war beat sure contemporary times contemporary times talk idea secession odds might happen mean united states way different states succeed sure one country several cultures since beginning absolutely reason someone goes back anarchist idea despise donald trump prerogative think joe biden clown prerogative absolutely reason governed someone disapprove incoherent nonsensical concept reason even take hypothesis trained contrary since kindergarten secession know along lines increasingly becoming harder harder people conversations think social media something people despise social media think something social media done well advocating tends run ideas evolutionary process drive logical conclusion hard moderate online going people pushing ideas several cycles going end kind pure want dislike extreme perspective different pockets really governable people fundamentally different worldviews know secession would look like think number really increasing exponential rate number supporters supporters think claim accomplished violence false lie like divorce involve beating much looking forward becoming reality far quicker ever expected well think value competing worldviews forced space within context group one thinks b c fundamental aspects worldview argue within group two thinks e f argue within going lot argument within space fundamental differences worldview reason especially views completely incoherent unreasonable think line fundamentally different worldviews along secession happen united states something emerges set ideas like call ca come agreement yeah think already happening masks think two fundamental perspective one thinks insane also deadly destructive see discourse topic left would say left versus right think people versus people risk averse yeah risk averse hope comfort centralized science giving truth everybody must follow truth proper way behave side distrust centralized institutions anybody might use control try gain greater greater power masks simple even masks efficacious yeah effective way stopping virus really unfortunate perspective happen survey paper masks people seem care data correct become nice point highlight difference two sides yeah sounds face ridiculous secession would occur masks would saying example something clean break risk averse versus someone risk seeking two fundamentally different perspectives one nhs one healthcare system make valid arguments reason everyone one think something think irreconcilable word space ideas room together fight ultimately make progress secession effective way proceed forward yes see possible world answer meaning know say yes lean side freedom anarchism yes let make argument terms divorce worldview intuition want make secession frictionless possible course going lie states whatever want choose want free yes peaceful let make authoritarian okay papa stalin papa stalin argument terms relationships shit goes wrong watch language okay place one stall table okay okay get lenin get like merkel previous discussion putin okay let unleash hounds want work troubles get divorced want work relationships sometimes goes plus years done listen okay one night stand look trump see middle ground either complete calamity buffoon first great president many many years think something different years ago yes social media access information division increase think oh yes trump accident history thought trump river dam trump dam thought river analogy trump gone makes things worse yes perspective things really going hit fan odds secession know desperate hope peaceful think number people becoming comfortable violence making unsettled well see words violence twitter like hiroshima times million sometimes curl corner crying check twitter feed seriousness think possible secession like czechoslovakia look brexit brexit secession right right civil war need fought would secession worry slavery could bought slaves import north still would cheaper less loss life probably better race relations yeah know enough history wonder civil war could avoided well well conversation like want secede say look going going let secede end slavery seceded slavery thing like circles conservatism myth oh slavery states rights well go back every state seceded released press release said explicitly slavery abomination needs taken care way countries ended slavery peacefully one ways pay end war think south people got reparations slave owners insane bring north want go canada whatever agree peace treaty people died slave owners white trash always hate term ca think better one always ends fighting wars often disproportionately poor people uneducated people regard cannon fodder think horrible would look like would two founding documents yeah constitution actually know history yeah constitution much decentralized secession happen yeah said donald trump dam river yeah sounds like walt whitman something poetry okay flirting know flirt goat club drag cave hammer stickle want know sickle good cop bad cop bad cop worse cop yeah think looks like terms candidates going kamala harris democratic candidate really looking forward ted cruz versus mike pence good debate would interesting see differentiate honestly mean things going get really ugly really soon donald trump coming back going things opinion think things going really really crazy talk damp gone year coming well yeah going complete mayhem think prediction wise empirical think donald trump twitter feed looks like end look back see obama gate exclamation points going first time history holding republican party accountable base never happen think going holding feet fire radicalizing given senate going democrats three seat majority house governing coalition either going complete mayhem actually look like key values think going try push think going contrarian going holding accountable terms budgeting even though never president think terms kind nominations thing first time since nixon years things politicized incoming president control senate senate vote kavanaugh positions see possibility trying pick fight one two nominations especially revenge kavanaugh going get bloody quickly think mitch mcconnell sadistic side revels brakes car think base going throwing going want bone like oh yeah eliminated one person going get really ugly really quickly see quite divisive like division increasing stabilizing decreasing part know part trying part like try like division shouting people like elon musk people actually building stuff like accomplishing things world terms like elon said took red pill see talking talking forget elon spacex tesla actually good sides like things google like actually building things like making world information searchable kind stuff like stuff know making actually world better place bunch technologies increasing quality life kind stuff feel like get like much credit public discourse division division like like people clouding ability concentrate awesome world well know would eliminate division right secession yeah see hard disagree hard disagree time secession romantic heart divorce breaks heart cool want live country cool story bro yeah want live country joe rogan regarded example someone spreading white supremacy well see feel like country live new york times cathedral regular basis cathedral okay cathedral guess maybe define cathedral like centralized institutions like story trying sell mobux concept yeah basically set limits permissible discourse create narrative population follow minority people minorities always controlling everything country vast majority masses thought yeah minorities overthrown circulation elites yeah way pro progress looks like ridiculous people take power yes get annoying new ridiculous people little bit better overthrow previous people think progress happens despite people power right session always overthrowing powerful progress happens think progress happens despite powerful powerful going power maintain power going fight innovation threat control always going new york times world right always going people sure let country two countries one joe rogan one new york times basically happening right geographically map well culturally yes cultural stuff layer public discourse okay mean like operating actual progress made like roads built hospitals run kinds things like sure different innovations seems like secession counterproductive right one country would roads would hospitals great point point trying make feels like division experiencing space ideas could constructive productive building better roads better hospitals opposed using division separate countries going solve problems feels like sure solve differently compete way mass great example competing question yeah seeing right different countries different mass mandates things like competition within structure within founding documents institutions effective think effective separating effective certain point think long passed governing consensus ideologically culturally let ask fun question okay knock knock mars god war one planet yeah kind captivating notion might excited human stepping foot mars like one things feels like want engage space exploration bit elon musk obvious eventually human species survive going innovate ways includes space okay lot things able predict yet push limits space new ideas come obvious years even imagining colonizing mars idea seems ridiculous exceptionally difficult impossibly expensive something actually going seen obvious retrospect engage okay contextualize things fun idea experiment philosophical political sense kind government orchestrate government go mars like get many chances like build new systems place old ones place system previously existed think organically hate word correct word would figure mean america built jamestown colony tried communism completely failed went free market system second wave colonists understanding mars mean depends population population number people know kind hypotheticals really good insight whatsoever space person hate astronomy like hate lot people look stars filled awe wonder mystery universe look stars feel looking looking earth look much rather given choice mars deep sea much rather spend week deep sea life forms literal aliens like things literal unimaginable us things yeah true interesting thought experiment see people hundred people build effective know actually really useful company right build effective company things obvious despite everybody really certain everything modern world obvious like run successfully group people agree saying also organic means look people tailor organization opposed try impose something get also select people right cause going open borders mars oh right going say one country open borders yeah right outer space right say aliens already going negotiate sure aliens aliens somebody legal aliens think alien civilizations yes course think system government anarchism advanced honestly think intelligent life forms course math impossible make stories ufo sightings kind stuff think visited earth yes grandfather air traffic controller soviet union said would often see things operating way knew vehicles operate good enough mean think government possession like think government kind information think somebody understanding ufo sightings kind information extraterrestrial life forms known public yes indisputably true think fact many sightings aerodynamic professionals like pilots things nature people seen reputable record saying seen things make sense russians americans thought one says something bigger problem bigger news bigger problem government fact hiding guess like going information good question like ufo extraterrestrial spacecraft likely would like crappy space would actual aliens would like drone probe ship ai yeah like would information somebody charge know like see badly fumbled discussion masks masks yeah masks one everything really terms communicating public honestly know know trivial one right know certainly feel incompetent able communicate effectively public something much difficult much full mystery like thing piece material earth forget like organic material know scientist perspective would beautiful would inspiring reveal world mystery make completely public share china share everybody think domino effect concern would else hiding us point said everything people would believe would ca blame believing ah yeah like show us aliens like craft lying speaking aliens offline mentioned elves yeah psychedelics yeah think psychedelics terms kind places take mind kind journey take like think think psychedelics human mind say capacity human mind general like mysteries know understand way heard explained much human mind receiving information blocking information right much data coming moment basically train see want see psychedelics tear away suddenly much aware also going noticing patterns noticed know researcher show kind discussed length mean rogan probably person popularized dmt well obviously person popularized dmt anything know anyone even researchers anything close coherent explanation drug exists everywhere would specific extreme effect many people going experiencing bizarre consequences result think interesting talking government cia started experimenting lsd killed one people drove suicide lot research terrence mckenna talks field quickly got mainstream shut even though addictive cause go crazy anything like lot propaganda use think thankfully somewhat receding think colorado legalized mushrooms something like think interesting see happens result yeah interesting thing seem certain psychedelics like psilocybin like mushrooms seem lethal dose fascinating like matthew johnson hopkins professor mentioned definitely going one studies really cool way calls heroic dose psilocybin oh want let let know heroic dose holy crap yeah safe many grams talking know big says going kick yeah says mean also studies cocaine studies kinds

back think robespierre much anarchist yeah get saying think centralized place news well mainstream media supposed represent world broken well whatever call place people traditionally said like legitimate source truth media supposed represent big branding accomplishment complete lie never true yeah happens remember war remember main take cuba yellow journalism willy randolph hearst right record scratch objective like transition happen according people saying kaiser worst human earth downplaying stalin downplaying hitler atrocities saying vietnam point wmds change never changed better con artists certain point mask dropping yeah think best like investigative journalism uncover truth way like reddit subreddits ca know reddit sure agree best absolutely even dispute like think like fake make right way meaning like make news meant news saying like dream arriving truth reporting truth say cnn advertisement said apple report facts lie clear things changed changed aware chicanery okay many people died iraq saddam hussein launch wmds consequences one minor thing lots dead people yeah also mean dead people horrible also money like said economic effects marianne williamson think trump great point goes like trillion dollars many schools would build many roads would build even building hospitals iraq destroyed could building hospitals makes sense horrifying responsible like alex jones meant well responsible arriving truth speaking money spent wars iraq one great things social media twitter faith twitter specific twitter yeah social media whole anyone another great example talking police brutality riots would perceive way framed presented nicholas sandman another example breonna taylor things well footage would perceive way edited presented corporate press everyone video camera everyone perspective useful incidents happen could see incident several angles need lemon chris wallace tell means see eyes yeah pleasantly surprised power see mob gets way get emotional destroy ability people reason right truth unobstructed social media careful patient see truth yeah example data covid best sources doctors like wan na know truth coronavirus happening follow people twitter certain people like sourcing versus cdc fast mean well kind anarchy right yes kind anarchy yes mean well censorship kind stuff censorship anarchy sense talking like people kicked twitter drawing boundaries get somebody okay mean private company private company people would say twitter working probably take granted well working complaining small part broken right yeah okay another question feel better way mean personal gripe situation personal gripe felt overly emotional possibility donald trump messing election process made feel better like saying like bunch opportunities would done dictator would first time riots george floyd would instituted martial law know remember vividly everyone waiting george bush give speech approved rating remember vividly cause said suspending constitution everyone would cheered like could get enough support time ca say anything really good george bush fan say least think people familiar totalitarian regimes extent ancestry whatever research always ones freaking warning also aware got ways go hitler thankfully lot dominoes fall place hitler like game secret hitler board game hitler becomes hitler like especially america lots things happen really get point mean fdr intents purposes dictator even worst could say something take lightly internment japanese citizens murdered lock key sense like cells things could gotten lot worse mean hitler horrible person bring mussolini yeah mussolini better hitler closely connected atrocities holocaust stuff led war war say holocaust hitler would probably viewed differently yes think well mean think controversial stance think hitler would viewed differently holocaust well mean funny thing would say death many million mean know calculate seen bad six million oh yeah mao stalin yeah interesting working working yeah next book talking reminding well good glad good writer world reminded last book new right deal like nazis one points make come everyone knows holocaust one knows holodomor right know great example western media depraved also human beings capable scars still many americans think russia ukraine thing like oh trump bed ukrainians trump russians think thing us complete lunacy kind thing pol pot another example people clue done fellow man face earth know much lay hands communism much like jordan pearson intricately connecting atrocities like saying ukraine people starved recently grandmother recently passed away survived kid fat people mean tough tough like whole region tough survived right occupation nazis germans much lay communism ideology versus stalin man think lenin building concentration camps around slave labor think clearly certain variants communism far like khrushchev gorbachev reason soviet union fell apart kind gon na spoil end book amazing book called revolution like beautiful book ever read victor sebastian hungarian author basically happens poland elections kind let labor people government people start crossing borders eastern bloc hanukkah eastern germany ceausescu romania calling gorbachev two toughest ones communist standards go escaping gon na lose everything got ta send tanks like hungary like czechoslovakia gorbachev goes sending tanks go dude send tanks done goes nope kind guy right ceausescu personally shot wife wall hanukkah forget happened friend born czechoslovakia mom pregnant communism never even imagined free born free looking around countries like trick right trying figure good arrest us en masse even within communism bad guys better guys talked anarchy talked democracy see like democratic socialism conversations going popular culture socialism seen like evil people great sure thoughts political ideology evil evil side fundamentally yes makes evil like structurally try analyze sure say three ways morally person right tell another person live life economically possible make calculations socialism prices information tells oh need produce need produce less without prices able adjust give information producers consumers way able produce effectively efficiently also turns people force people interact force relationships force jobs give choice monopoly consequence monopoly everyone familiar ostensibly capitalism somehow government monopoly economic principles work make sense force democracy saying bit force socialism yeah interesting say enough information mean ultimately need really good data achieve goals system even corruption right need information right ca capitalism provides really strong information capitalism best cleanest like perfect information available manipulation information one problems okay talk candidates ones got possible alternatives one question within system candidates seems maybe correct highly unsatisfactory like like anyone actually excited current candidates kind excited matter wins elections gon na hilarious something excited humor perspective yeah whole system one theory case entire thing optimized viewership yeah excitement definitions like reality show kind excitement think look happened brett kavanaugh career would draw people might say quality matter would huge incentive team denigrate humiliate worst possible ways two teams lose legitimacy among gen pop gon na get harder harder maintain kind claims authority something like kind play know certain nefarious ways people best best gon na wan na politicians yeah could job job interview running yahoo whatever could months eat know corn dogs looking like going someone shake hands family social media daily called worst things still guaranteed position flip side like perspective competition weak meaning like need certain minimum amount eloquence clearly bar pass think either would considered particularly eloquent biden trump know saying competition like wanted become politician wanted run president opportunity like competent like like andrew yang example somebody bunch ideas somewhat eloquent like young energetic feels like thousands andrew yangs like would answer domain went nowhere well well would say went nowhere generated quite bit excitement go far okay run president generate excitement ideas could podcast host even joking right right right andrew yang oh podcast yeah podcast called yang speakers oh okay cool oh wow music way said yeah cool way mom talks tell something exciting going life oh nice honey oh made robot oh cool mixed coffee oh still single though wonder wonder make robot wife give robot grandchildren okay first okay let ask andrew yang represents fresh energy find fresh energetic like candidate wish mix mix wish one last two remaining yeah people like marion williamson thought great tulsi thought great amy klobuchar got bad rap think held smart particularly funny okay think lot people like guess named women interesting even intentional tulsi like aggressive good resume staying course establishment marion williamson like comes place seems genuine compassion maybe sociopath know read book actually affected profoundly rare read book even one idea blows mind kind think time one idea book teaching something called course miracles hollywood think still teaches high aids crisis young men prime life dropping like flies trying give hope well good luck dying one cares like ca tell us gon na cure like lie goes told gon na cure told gon na like diabetes cut foot gon na go blind would something hope put like like yeah like talking someone like homeless junkie like could doctor lawyer lawyer like cool story like could studio apartment terrible roommate shitty job street cooking breakfast teaspoon hear like wait would really bad really much worse becomes something put terms like wow woman really number terms teaching people hopeful small steps guess also becomes less need miracle like oh really manageable yeah absurd think impossible take bret weinstein pushed forward doa could even stand twitter dead arrival dead arrival could even stand twitter let alone facebook got blocked let alone hugely problematic way twitter would block know blocked believe know problematic means word lot work people wanted conceptually idea like unity like taking rejects party gon na like something one likes therefore gon na compromise absurd last time kind unity ticket civil war andrew johnson democrats lincoln republicans something ended well particularly nicely halves country way see like way saw guess looked carefully either fair yeah way saw emphasizing centrists tulsi centrist tulsi involved yes trying push tulsi like jesse ventura something oh okay know know specifics scientist also know centrism coherent term politics see like pleading authority ego pleading approach data someone saying mean accurate mean mean mean could anywhere function around mean true even know centrist supposed mean exactly means idea centrist center right center left means somebody liberal conservative empathetic side joe biden crime bill joe biden voted republican supreme court justices joe biden voted balanced budget joe biden voted jewish war sure probably looked patriot act joe want centrist joe biden yeah okay worked well republicans argument could made course everybody always resist argument indeniable fact campaign activists started yelling town hall yelling saying hey need open borders joe biden says open borders go vote trump literally turn back man primaries would behoove try appeal base course probably also make argument donald trump center right center left well mean unique personality look record first time rhetoric say centrist terms governs budgeting mean moderate certainly like draconian budget cuts supreme court could say okay hard right immigration could say certain capacities hard right terms done terms many aspects much kind republican certainly rhetoric hard make case centrist like idea find compelling like like und idea different way like different party different path forward ideas like anarchy interesting idea leads discourse leads think interesting think interesting sweden eight parties parliament iceland populations like got nine think czech republic nine britain five claim two parties censorious speech three oh sudden makes sense port data number one number two donald trump demonstrated basically third party candidate seize machinery existing party appropriate ends bernie sanders bernie sanders never democrat major credit easy elected senator independent done repeatedly two examples ossified elites right picking third party makes real sense speaking party talk quite bit let like personal challenge let bring libertarian party personal challenge go five minutes without mocking discussing idea first trolled yeah okay trolled yeah trolled okay good remember fun friends episode chandler friend episode chandler make fun people like go one day chandler phoebe starts telling ufo saw like interesting nice exactly okay true master would able play within game within constraints pretty sure still mock stick rules five minutes easy first speaking broadly libertarianism speak feel also libertarian party implementation current system think libertarianism great idea think many libertarian ideas become much mainstream happy remember article either new york new yorker magazine early talked cato institute libertarian think tank referred fact cato war regulation wacky consistency know reconcile two things remember two things remember expression wacky consistency even taught much internet two tribes hate gays socialized medicine also means free speech whole menu got sign menu terrible hate america want destroy oh god horrible evil menu want libertarian party extent libertarian whole said know chinese buffet take look column look column b ideology coherent consistent ideology peace things like libertarian party takes model early progressive populist parties early th century effective terms getting people elected extremely effective terms getting two major parties appropriate adopt ideas implement britain well liberal party got destroyed became taken labour alternative party tories ideas basically become mainstreamed think libertarian friend passed away eric miss dearly webmaster whole point think terms party terms getting people elected think party terms getting people educated alternatives enormous use perspective think absurd perspective libertarian ideas become extremely mainstream war last resort something taught kids say many years like think last resort like something bad well like first instinct like let really give week week like going syria really gon na genocide kurds things like one another thing drug legalization kids oh crazy hippies wan na smoke pot like grand jury point people make sure selling weed let say selling life ruined imprisoned rapists murderers like say yes say yes acknowledge meaning lot people like wait minute got ta third option consequences imprisoned rapist like comfortable either think one increasing skepticism libertarians top first hard left police asset forfeiture steals people burglaries people know asset forfeiture cops come house suspect convicted using car house whatever terms selling drugs take whatever want sue prove innocence get property back complete violation due process people realize going great way cops increase budgets legal libertarians like first big ones saying guys american crazy increasingly people conservatives left like wait minute even selling drugs like take house talking think mechanisms libertarianism though name become far popular yeah interesting idea yeah coherent set ideas eventually get integrated two party system war interesting one right wonder thread wonder connects think patriot act patriot act okay people politically savvy like oh okay joke really crazy infringement freedoms parties falling sign law orwellian name wan na patriotism kind person know mean think lot people especially civil libertarians left lot conservatives constitutionalists like wait minute comfortable also comfortable comfortable everyone washington right probably libertarians libertarianism place ideas connection like every time listen folks like feel connected would even sometimes depending day call libertarian spectrum spectrum yeah look people actually rise top terms people represent party five minutes ran right could go allowed go weird strong candidates emerging represent political like representatives like famous speakers like represent ideology think libertarians tend think jonathan haidt book research political scientist lot things people come political conclusions factors force people reach conclusions found libertarians least empathetic rationalistic groups means like think terms logic opposed like people feelings positives negatives ab testing ron paul ron paul ran president libertarian nominee nominee got pretty much nowhere ran return republican party congressman many years texas ran presidency stood stage rudy giuliani told would shocking horrifying taboo years earlier many people like holy crap amazing giuliani offended ron paul took guts way heard refreshing said fact said something took guts made realize rare politicians even people say something takes guts well also idea like ca even think america right invade country earth much wants kill people consequence war blow buildings destroy country ca straight face expect us consequences even consequences evil people even good guys bad guys bad guys still gon na try something happens next know mean kind concept american culpability america good guys definition culpable people start thinking another way kind back door talking different scenarios fact got much traction republican fact donald trump came nowhere became candidate president tells people like getting book deal right either go three choices either mainstream publisher independent publisher independent publisher worst choices getting big advance gon na able promote lot get distribution mainstream done mainstream right self cred respectability mainstream cache new york times bestseller right takes lot work get lot profit looks good shelf amazon looks identical forth mainstream benefits costs pretty much obvious people thing like either independent like ross perot could seize one party apparatus benefits enormous terms going third party know libertarian party apparatus maybe ballot access really efficacious gon na lot baggage hear independent jesse ventura ross perot think person define defend party two bridges people brilliant input okay thank let speak speaking yaron brooks soon oh yeah like yeah another example ask tell joke ayn rand one criticism heard say unable speak weaknesses either ayn rand objectivist worldview yes really put know half joking actually legitimate discussion joking one criticisms one explanations world seems disrespect ayn rand people kind implies ideas like flawless says correspond reality yeah right term uses mean objectivist name facts like impossible basically argue pretty simple facts well possible argue would say never met good critic argue facts misrepresentation entirely wrong often caricatured extreme personality extreme worldview mean people guy named physics mathematics community called stephen wolfram know wolfram alfow yeah okay style speaking sometimes like created science turns lot people like kind weird confidence one favorite people think one brilliant people ignore little bit ego whatever call beautiful ideas oh yeah amazing person objectivism undereducated hope educated interesting ideas like ufos connection two bring wo like wo trans like ufos oh interview yeah know good yarn okay little bit sense objectivism interesting ideas useful think copy first printing fountainhead tell little bit affection miss rand heavy goes ayn rand answers questions study rand going forced think basic things gon na eyes open heavily perfect never claimed perfect asked donahue true according philosophy perfect said never think way said ask practice preach answer yes resoundingly fascinating woman really interesting something appreciate personally read essays weird sides looked like talking art like us country nuclear weapons follow brilliant mind making seemingly disparate connections something find absolutely inspiring awesome entertaining think lots things people like yaron would make uncomfortable well like objectivism like philosophy techniques kind hand wave away things wan na talk like pretend talk things like metaphysical significance right means like well ah wan na talk like matter like literally means fancy philosophical terms matter say correctly twisted culture heroes look flaws instead looking virtues valid perspective however sitting telling think woman badass amazing studied also idiosyncrasies wan na hear think convenient lot things example rand pro happiness pro pleasure pro sex kind surprising looking talked strident result never got cats fixed deny pleasure orgasm male cats spraying entire house like mean putting philosophy practice still gross kind thing think another thing rand article woman president said woman never president right rand says things goofy say oh objectivism personal preference like lines objectivism always defined ayn rand writings plus additional essays books part books counts official objectivism pretend otherwise another example plus bet spectrum extent joking using derisively belief inaccurately humor used denigrate humiliate thinking jon stewart type jon stewart lot times like use mocking resentful correctly lot times people great accomplished little nobodies make punchline bring disavow example thought remember remember must segment mtv musicians making perfumes girl grabbed prince perfume even smelled joke ready goes oh smells almost bad music lately like first sure perfume fine second prince one time greats ca wait denigrate like part wan na like dare like perfume way way mitigates amazing accomplishments achievements horrible person great ayn rand jokes would happy perfume thing problem funny oh sucks okay great dared try humorous cause know mentioned jon cause jon funny right taught generation still see twitter things inherently sarcastic snide mean practicing use irony sarcasm example people like say something someone replied like last checked blah blah blah blah blah say go think saying last checked added point giving valuable information data trained believe couched sneering give information useful information yeah true knee jerk see jon stewart masterfully correct like people copy certain comedians try copy lose everything process copying yeah yep okay terms philosophy selfishness kind individual focused idea imagine connects yes think would connect people understood meant nathaniel brandon heir kind broke atlas shrugged said one say ayn rand views straight face wo say believe happiness matters important worth fighting ayn rand says dangerous easy say could dangerous consequences sociopath put terms think extremely healthy think people wan na happy think lot us raised apologetic especially cynical media culture say wan na happy wan na love life like okay sweetheart eye rolling think pernicious horrifying camus person camus thought arch enemy cynicism could agree like kind person someone likes band like oh likes blah blah blah like gives happiness yeah certain exceptions gives happiness cool okay beautiful agree eye rolling see best trolling eye roll correct course best trolling taking eye rollers gon na think okay another red bull yeah yeah cause put blood type red bull kind put bin okay okay right another example trolling making jokes ron paul stroke right someone came like oh blah blah blah know ugly hope stroke hope hospital go stroke mom face came got put place subpar clever clever particularly one things interesting mean give props sense willing go farther people expect yes fun yeah fact probably edit like half podcast thing kept mentioned michaela peterson podcast nice guess podcast mine referring mine yeah right went right tell paraphrase opened say jordan peterson dad many people know daughter yeah sorry dad yeah long issue substance addiction said famous jordan peterson daughter many people changed many lives around world enormous influence personally started taking benzodiazepines recreationally like oh god michael horrible yeah pulled talking mean know going rough time going everything pulled emotionally like gon na sweet mike gon na wonderful bam props whatever art form done well taken far criticism feels good people mean oh happy reverent show care anything another form cynicism though right think possible troll still live life highest ideal camus sense try kind ideal believe becomes drug feel like takes like think love ultimately way experience like every moment every day think expression honestly think let split hairs think something use think able make laugh year hell create element love connection yeah know would say yes said combination sweetness everywhere else kindness subtle thing like like deepest connection others like mock lovingly yes correct like stuff kindness around sometimes words like subtle things creates air familial like together yeah missing difficult internet agree agree like general approach internet like simple less witty like dumbly loving core competency witty yeah witty saying core company saying bad saying go like organically especially strangers feel like nobody core competence internet guess want bring love world nobody core competence given current platforms nobody core competence wit difficult witty internet without still communicating kindness like give another example way physical space give another example someone came like gave donation people time go oh like started reading books wife watch shows together keep good work go boyfriend think example wit love person feels seen acknowledging also making joke expense know joke good point good point good point language often used ways cue emotional connectivity difficult difficult done difficult accomplish done well mean like live streams nice people give bunch money donations stuff often like make fun certain aspects questions love genuine annoyance asked really dumb questions still underlying even like kind person communicated interesting know get twitter know get video something face something yeah course data easy convey emotion subtlety absolutely literally black white letters gon na whatever white black night mode gon na different much limited information yeah fundamental thing another example like access face like lot times people know come call nazi right start talking jews terrible jews audience knows jewish went yeshiva sitting laughing person making ass person idea video would like okay wait minute something yeah something know think entertaining think fun think scalable ultimately trying figure whole trolling thing think really destructive outrage mob outrage mobs dynamics twitter really bothering okay trying figure try build alternative twitter perhaps try encourage twitter better nuanced healthy conversations like reason talk love love sake good base difficult conversations like good starting point start like would argue kind conversation twitter fun might good starting point difficult nuanced conversation well interested conversations people know agree point valid yes like saying trying difficult nuanced conversation say race america policing racism institutional racism policing okay conversations nuanced heard podcasting medium agree magic podcasting great downside podcasting small number people even thousands still small millions people social media nuanced conversation capable difference mind believe data us scientific data support world either making claim well looking object claim oh broken well claim people fundamentally stupid martial artist yes feel judo judo really think people deep like capable intelligent deep surface joking tongue cheek cynical think capacity gon na think clear even gon na think know evidence position proof course data little use interest lot times audience big mine people come people say thing concept say concept way mind yeah surface evidence saying iceberg looks like surface saying iceberg challenged rise occasion deep thinking saying nope nope frozen water atmorozhene russian expression ice cream morozhene atmorozhene mean like one actually know yeah means like yeah atmorozhene yeah like thought means toop nikava doma nikava doma okay well challenging little bit rigorous think try challenging anything challenging like challenging based saying like prove wrong find actual data show wrong think would need get data funny said think working biography ego hebra title suggested little engine could like think great title pretty good yeah speaking biographies mean one read book listened book listened audio book right yeah audio yeah yeah read golas yes okay yarrow brooke voice book different voices lisp want sound like making fun yeah remember reading really enjoying promise okay good like year year half ago read ca prove well let high level see pull ask book write group people united solely opposition progressivism little else common frequently caricatured dismissed larger establishment media give kind story came sure like talking trolls internet side things quite interesting first connect new right subset new right feels race racism one important sociopolitical issues folks like part mainstream worth paying attention mainstream definition would part mainstream would part would know well worth position position say worth would say use familiar arguments dismiss school thought especially one historically gained leverage especially one historically gained leverage dark ways especially america europe places say oh racist need think behoove lessons draw chan side things like internet side movement tits get fuck define every single word tits breasts get fuck chan okay mean oh sometimes like woman appear chan reply tits get fuck trying understand oh oh way slow oh okay disrespectful towards female members community understand rules community one good women one rules principle rule principle principle going ever get laid fundamental principle principles gon na get pics pics sometimes sometimes internet sometimes gtfo okay actual principles like maybe naive perspective like darkest aspects trolling like take nothing serious make game everything chan per se one things learn chan think healthy idiosocratic unique worldview focus aspect history culture able find people engage discuss without preemptively dismissive ideal well ideal something happens lot chan really like paul board politics get like people much erudite think take perception take nothing seriously things take seriously like discussing ideas give one example video someone posted girl put kittens bag threw river found within day got like arrested yeah take things seriously okay like extreme mean good first heartwarming would somehow turn thing feels like one chan chan twice good chan yeah slogan feels like kind community would take kitten situation make mockery yeah darker chan yeah even even allowed talk chan already overwhelmed clearly chan lingo actually literally wrote notes like research conversation learned word pleb wanted ask pleb means know pleb means saw mean actually know pleb know pleb like plebiscite plebian okay mean something sophisticated unsophisticated mechanism dismissive like regular people yeah someone comes twitter okay right back chan alt right different concepts conflate internet culture born well born blogs people different blogs posting called like racial realism scientific racism breaking issues racialist perspective chan much dynamic message board fluid lend kind analysis ideas history spreads like spreads memes yeah know essential mechanism historically mostly blogs okay make psychology kind worldview goes conspiracy theory subject earlier little bit knowledge something history one talking one group talking alternative answers going drawn group issues race homophobia taboo culture understandably good reasons start putting things like old sex kids regular conversations eventually people gon na start taking positions like things sanctified extent ones talking gon na drawn subculture stand mean hear term used term weaponized corporate press people want read society used individual levels like people like gavin mcinghis milo yiannopoulos others mean think referred trump become slur like incel bot become largely removed original meaning sense still movement like yeah call okay something called dissident right say completely like b c b c huge overlap much people intellectuals still represent somehow aspect movement mean sure tracking much anymore think find particularly book done looking history next book mentioned communism gon na talk lot cold war kind stuff largely fallen away radar extent also effective movement get marginalized silenced deep concern terms concern impact society yes much lessened yeah troll twitter best sense word make cancel culture think maoism mean corporate america done far better job implementing maoism communist party ever could meeting long ago think northwestern university law school everyone call got said racist mean something legally averse saying even true kind concept getting confessing sins collective something completely oh sorry admitted yeah like saying white inherently racist name john racist name racist hear like okay looting tunes saying wow much took step saying like deep underlying force sense cancel culture kind mob symptom mob systemic organized movement used nefarious purposes dominate entire nation fight sense inside used defend academia still extent nuanced discussion like folks like jordan peterson lot people kind attack academia refer really talking gender studies certain departments mit university science engineering faculty really think issues traditionally thought beginning even infiltrate starting infiltrate engineering sciences outside biology let put biology gender studies talking sciences really anything gender starting infiltrate worries know exactly know exactly negative effect would except feels like oh yes course sure surface feels like path towards progress first like zoomed like squinting eyes even detail looking things actually join conversation listen conversation quote unquote diversity quickly makes realize interest making better world domination getting yeah way lowest status white person using mechanism feel superior another human useful terms fighting one suggestions seize university endowments crystallization privilege distribute money reparations effective turning two populations strongly diminishing university intellectual hegemony universities absolutely real villains picture thankfully also least prepared aggressed upon government corporate press last leg stool know coming gon na get ugly wait disagree one would yeah disagree sense want dismantle broken institutions think broken powerful working like design think years talking bringing next generation american leaders code promulgating ideology based egalitarian principles world domination let try express lived experience okay sure experience mit bunch administrators bureaucracy say nice thing podcast give damn pretty useless fact get way faculty professors incredible incredible human beings day busy part day like continually pursue different little trajectories curiosities various avenues science work side effect mentor group students sometimes large group students also teach courses constantly sharing passion others experience bunch people curious engineering math science chemistry artificial intelligence computer science familiar never feeling mit broken somehow like kind feeling like talk like eric weinstein feeling like stuff fire right something deeply broken system especially covid kind tension everything great discussion even diversity kind stuff toxic stuff might talking right none happening bunch people love cool ideas exploring ideas curious learning kind stuff sense academia place kids continue playground science fun destroy academia destroy universities like suggesting kind lessening power take away playground kids play gon na hard tell yeah well guess saying certain kinds playgrounds yeah ones broken glass floor yeah kinds playgrounds nope see see yes see listen wait yeah would say watchful mother one kid hurt glass one kid entire generation generation generation watchful mother guy flamethrower understand using one kid always kind like weird gender studies department hurt glass opposed people like obviously fun playground playing glass broken glass mean best innovations science happen universities okay ca forget universities liberal like politics like literally every conversation year year something happening every conversation ever nothing politics never trump never came none ever come nothing like kind idea liberal humanities yeah think mit massachusetts institute technology might little bit outlier yeah probably yeah honestly think people criticize academia looking fact also picking outliers picking quote unquote strongest gender studies department nonsensical bucknell college student take know bunch electives want take class american individualism one texts five read birth nation movie klan department people thoroughgoing hardcore ideologues gender studies humanities fine humanities gender studies okay fine give history english every university know mandatory curriculum take bunch propaganda classes look forward youtube comments eloquent speaking thing lot people agree usual slow self people going say nice things say anything nice lex please let try shoot school would preferable goes teachers go darkest possible place sunshine baby schools everyone goes happy playgrounds goes dark ear dives right like go dark comes back surface feel way anymore one day probably figment imagination even podcast well red bulls surprised could see anything like fight club red bull gives delirium yeah got ed norton yesterday twitter oh really yeah like rest celebrities yeah like oh existential threat america trump fascist delegitimizing oval office said odd endorsement trump well went brad pitt might different opinion true fight club reference okay conversation interesting like draw line science engineering science including biological aspect parts biology touch humanities biology feel humanities look percentage universities still minority percentage would actually draw different think serve different purposes sure actually broken part universities like best research world done universities like might different like mit feels weird yeah conceptually different things like research teach diagram yeah feels weird also coming like defense engineers never talk like mind like deluded something seeing house fire saying seeing house also lived harvard square seeing harvard see tanks coming coming lex gon na beautiful like american beauty plastic bag wo able stop crying beautiful yeah thanks already see engineering departments like believe elon musk world innovation make better world happening like let burn nothing like like sitting quietly like humanities kinds diversity programs discussions listen soviet brother know know ice water runs veins calling mercy wired closing door yeah actually realizing people listening probably saying even slower usual sleep last night feel actually realizing slow much preparation need would like defend aspects academia better come prepared think need defend think granting premise freely might okay think world actually defeat argument way phenomenal research institution like mit one disputes also educational establishment two things necessarily interconnected offer way separate correct big fan everybody different fan criticizing institutions without offering way change especially like ability change like offer path students mentor opposite mentor mentee protégé term work place interns intern one thinking anyway basically working instead going college possible going tradition build new institutions ca engineers building new things crazy research engineers gon na building things well one things kind fan apprentice word looking apprentice ironic talking trump could think word apprentice yeah well done fired go russian jews quick wit okay thing fan freedom intellectual freedom trying articulate failing articulate truly complete intellectual freedom within universities topics science engineering believe agree think gon na take much persuasion give example sure know details scientist engineered probe land comet articles written hawaiian shirt wearing like pinup girls think female student sewed something apologize rand talking yeah great accomplishments men say sorry lowest despicable disgusting people yeah know let bring case think might mean much means lot certain aspect computer science community guy named richard stallman know know founder free software foundation like big linux one key people history computer science one open source people right like believe one hardcore ones like software free okay okay interesting personality key person like new like linus torvald key person also kind speaks mind certain chain conversations mit leaked new york times published led fired pushed mit recently maybe year ago always

mythical southy think mythical southy something long gone term actually sobo oh yeah changed took know goodwill hunting personality southy strong accent bad ass dudes came right end like south boston got gym south boston neighborhood starting change think gentrification happened started building luxury condominiums buying old businesses mom pop businesses think kind changed makeup community influx new young people disposable income exodus older people kind grew raised families offered humongous sums money homes bought like late early could develop areas combination influx new people exodus old got totally new neighborhood place love boston love still boston certainly love thing gone well yeah think wan na pinpoint pin boston happening great cities areas become gentrified happening personality character neighborhood run nothing people coming making money things like expense culture character personality neighborhood mean kind standing shoulders giants people came built areas happens boston happens new york happens west coast love boston nearly romantic might years ago used love new york love boston walkable food scene rise think hard pressed find charm people think think old boston old new england city see see differently people sometimes criticize mit thing think always like tend prefer carry flame greatness greatest moments history sort enjoy echoes halls mit way boston think history history lives individuals ca look around boston like boston become think always carried minority individuals think kind look back history think like times greater certain kind dimension back remember ridiculous driven assertion mine remember brightest stars history romanticize think look around special people still living boston boston remembered great city like years think probably right sort theory point like certain age life things resonate differently like think done studies people stop searching new music age dads see like wearing super old clothes like style time period last great part life like evolution people could also memories live course neighborhood best fun always kind look things tint think right think anything wrong way cities evolving prefer time like mom pop store fabricated like gastropub could like four lane super highway way epcot center actually owned like conglomerate still special places like takes us back road trip maybe tend romanticize experiences like diners middle nowhere would say makes like feels like life made experiences maybe paper seem mundane actually somehow give chance pause reflect life like certain kind people whether like really close friends complete strangers maybe alcohol involved middle nowhere seems like road trip facilitates allow like think makes kinds experiences think context road trip think like think experiences along way people people color experiences differently depending person road trip took somebody else alone driven east coast several times drove la new york friend run cops trying get traffic tickets yeah traffic tickets yeah allegedly trying get la going go away little drove la young kids idea drove east unbelievable trip mostly really destination really timeframe thank goodness cause got arrested pennsylvania got kind stuck drove back la got pennsylvania stops along way kind like weird things like money right finding like little diamond rough place eat diner talk like place think buenos aires guy said know quaint little spot around corner young like thought coolest thing world would citizen world know quaint little spots around corner like great cities like know get great chicken sandwich argentina know get great meal costa rica know get super local egg another country thought really cool like ability anywhere world get closer guy trip found like took trip across united states guy friend mine different goals searching meaning life searching politically correct way phrasing basically trying sleep every kind woman world offer difference two things well guess searching different kinds meanings oh mean still think ca find meaning woman legs suppose made tried tension grew closer experiences gotten fights lot like literal almost fights close like silences like brothers whole weird journey friendship went think anytime spend much time like small space another person gon na different parts relationship manifest periods closeness periods vulnerability like maybe driving denver three morning talk something might otherwise talked periods wan na see motherfucker ever right depending could anything guy drove twice still still contact still buddies different goals also point lives never even contemplated meaning life probably point friend drove racking experiences whatever wan na able retell stories yeah wan na able retell got ta sound cool like wan na retell story yeah drove alabama got lovely library checked book interested retelling remember kids show remember stories kids would enjoy times profound kind way impactful moments beginning road trip money couple kids knew nothing literally stopped vegas went circus circus time blackjack like bucks buddy kind degenerate gambler knew like kind stuffing chips pockets making sure could pay gas point like starting line like drove la vegas four hours starting line realizing like may even like get starting line gon na two guys stuck vegas money ca go west gon na get pinched money go east hell gon na gon na wind vegas know kind profound thing turning potentially could turning point lives made enough money continue going east beautiful thing road trips broke like retrospect everything turned fine facing complete darkness uncertainty possibilities laid like know confident time like really full like like could see trajectories screw life like life failure like dreams never realized complete piece shit kinds things concept consequence like probably talk plasmosis literally concept consequence immediate gratification cared oh existentialist yeah even enter mind like early twenties anything point could reverberate rest life think part even think make far interested like long play remember thinking like acting way might impact point life never reach yet man searches meaning life least would say put another way think deeply world philosophical context also appreciating violence hurting friends right regular basis think mean maybe broader question also personal question seems people fight prolonged periods time like people mixed martial arts people even military folks become time philosophers parallel fighting violence philosophical depth arrived starting point full existentialist like living moment like introspective human would say soldier warrior hundreds years ago probably started marriage martial arts philosophy constantly someone else charge told go walk line overtake germanic tribe somewhere happens time job soldier given day might come home think start day thinking deeply lived point people living around treated think probably started marriage kind like philosophical martial artist got really like daily basis take stock going around inside suffer kind idea today last day right really much nowadays comfortable marched war every day think see people live little bit differently know treat people around little bit differently think echoes even sport like grappling facing mortality really think way honest think lot people train martial art contemporary society consider martial artists think train martial art mean martial artist many people use martial arts form exercise like little piece use martial arts tagline instagram bio really form exercise something something think big difference bunch stuff mixed instagram thing something also could something display versus private moments searching thinking struggling kind stuff instagram surface layer much modern society operates really problematic gap person show world person private life make majority project human project sort years earth optimization public instagram profile never develop private person seem long enough difficult fall like become personal journey intellectual journey get ass kicked thousands times certain point maybe like defense mechanism turns kind deeply profound introspective experience versus like exercise true yoga yeah let go back first address instagram point think difference people whose instagram intrinsically tied profession put specific profile think general people truthfully businesses tied instagram profile wan na exclude think people instagram want seen always congruent think level dishonesty like want people see gon na put stuff instagram bio really think little disingenuous right never really gon na marry two things together gets tough let sorry interrupt let push back something good time address many flaws great powerful john clark okay let go interesting strive hard excellence life extreme competence visibly physically put people achieved competence think nicer people early like mentioned person first picks art picks becomes vegan starts start first time create struggling like really overly proud kind ridiculous wise chair seen many battles yeah see ridiculousness tend learning give folks mock sort give chance ridiculousness think let first clarify wan na clear mean say level competence never world championship never know plenty things life achieved people would consider penultimate level success accomplishments accomplishments ribbons things like things mean anything fact arenas something wan na change talk second think difference eager noob whatever thing signal thing person less respect know primarily look tournament idea people espouse online respect anyone guts get mat put line sign tournament biggest load shit ever heard great know easy put name something pay registration fee walk hard part easiest part care lose first match respect person signs tournament registers tournament goes diet loses weight right way trains ass things properly goes mat person simply signs name registration form jumps mat done things actually nothing lose done stepped onto mat ring cage bucket full excuses sure signed really vulnerable run things supposed person eliminates every possible excuse steps mat gets ass kicked first round much respect person person nothing maybe natural ability wins couple matches writes facebook lost eventual champion worth zero worth zero process learn learned got natural level aptitude whatever activity actually learn maximize training dedication things incredibly interested novice musician like play bass put anything stink would really love sick currently running around talking entering things like wan na reach level competence person respect person takes fully seriously takes effort fully seriously bass would agree going perform live private moments private thoughts going give excuse like gon na fun nice experience going think going try best possible bass player given everything going life going like actually put line fail try failure exactly sit sick feeling like failure important thing know absolutely like best thing could sometimes fun lose bragging lesser ways life think careful many people life brought like little candle fire dream would go like would blow fire would dismiss see like would say said lot ridiculous stuff one always dreamed like putting always dreamed world full robots every time would bring ideas shut different people parents know need first get education need succeed dimensions order things get good grades blah blah blah blah blah like stuff indirect direct ways blowing little ridiculous dream present like know remember sort bringing know things like becoming state champion wrestling right weird dance course coaches tell kind dismiss like okay okay time feels like early days preserve little fire like johnny ive know know designer apple chief designer behind iphone stuff always talked would bring ideas steve jobs matured would always shit wanted like little babies like live little bit get completely shut always think see beginner sort bragging instagram careful let play little dream know playing little dream nurturing trying take little flame trying create roaring blaze playing idea behind substance hard know difference struggle think necessarily certainly wrong say instagram wan na impugn bunch strangers gym lot members tell number years gym someone comes says goal tell yes general know tell way say thin slice seen look people faces people start say wan na x z know right bat person either gon na put effort going put effort effort behind busting ass new something brand new working really hard series moderate successes guy wan na champion persistence grit time successes longer moderate huge person moderate success nothing chances never learn put work successes never grow admiration mike tyson love gon na let sit brief moment think combination factors one timeliness career age came prominence raw brutal violence raw brutal honesty speaks think easy people hear see life cast aside cretan scourge society hear speak guy unintelligent guy knows better probably us know disarming humongous part admiration mike tyson feels like similarities feels like violent person also really kind person living together little house thoughtful person also scary violent person picnic picnic think dialectical tensions everyone opposing forces constantly pulling different points life sliding scale think certainly younger person lot manifestation violence lot less kindness people close probably saw violent side close people saw would pass kind side sliding direction worry actually sometimes could situation need old version getting away ca call need concerns certain degree sad aging warrior seeing greater self fade away still compete person return seems like mike tyson person returned prospect competition returns learned better manifest competition terms effects type emotion physically middle competition better learned utilize energy think another side effect gym bigger guy head instructor ca mean violent also trying run business spend long many years trying mean soften technique little bit sudden becomes necessarily like trying reclaim little bit mat think competition athlete really wants score points fighter really wants incapacitate put position bidding result jiu jitsu match might still two points motivations different make tyson joe rogan saying aroused violence think insane think deeply honest think rings true many us others practice different degrees ca speak lot people think brutally honest statement think something even lot people feel comfortable admitting saying think great joy landing flush right hand someone jaw watching crumble even feel ever played baseball kid hit base hit end bat sting hands way hit hit home run wo feel anything feel good hands think one joys physical contact right way goes physical contact right way physical pleasure derive mental pleasure unparalleled see different let draw distinction fortune wrestler would draw distinction well executed competition double leg single leg takedown pin ocd person something comforting well executed pin like two seconds like everything flush nice like clean mean okay ocd person likes align show beautiful okay good technique wrestling also provides maybe sports feeling dominating another human yes breaking cocky powerful feel power another human breaking like honest mike tyson think ever sort looked mirror said like enjoyed aspect certainly seems like chase wrestler high school lost many matches overaggressiveness like would pick top position let stand could mat return trying return mat actually trying like drive mat ground like took like gave joy like like trying know return mat could pin talked like dominating another person used look got someone theory equally trained equally skilled absolutely totally dominating joy could get mma fight could take someone mount feels great start raining punches face mount like dropping elbows stuff like another level satisfaction tough describe think everyone made think senior high school wrestling coach said look got stop crazy aggressive wrestling like tried turn technician work degree humongous shift terms success level enjoyment like mean got disqualified new england coach said cross face cross face said harder basically wound blasted kid face nose got busted everywhere think felt good felt good cross face like lot like weird american warrior ethos picked also russian satya brothers see get draw think tension art martial art violence martial art poetic way could put fascinated dan gable dominating another human think effortlessness technique mastery art exhibited effortlessness much lose moment timing beauty timing like much like one example judo also wrestling look foot sweep wrestlers america even judo players america much world admire beauty foot sweep foot sweep way sort balance find right timing effortlessly change tape turn tables dominate opponent seen highest form mastery russian wrestling case judo japanese judo interesting sure tension think actually takes back know listen dan carlin hardcore history genghis khan ever read great book genghis khan yeah still trying adjust life said genghis khan right pronunciation actually genghis khan tension kind think know kind thought genghis khan ultra violent leader ultra violent men another view another way see people warriors valued extreme competence mastery art fighting weapons bows horse riding kind stuff sure exactly place sort thinking violence human history think context like combat sports think difference athlete winning contest certain set rules fighter winning fight exact rules different approach think one better like mma think great example would george pierre george pierre tremendous tremendous athlete considers martial artist first trying win athletic competition like nick diaz trying bust ass right different approach yes different results highest level competition difficult attribute difference results approach sport different human beings different abilities different physical attributes scytia brothers luxury able talk beauty perfectly timed slide right wrestlers never able pull therefore pursue ways defeat someone maybe dan gable breaking man spirit outworking type thing beautiful way tend ways able successful kind take deep dive think beautiful brute force effortless execution technique dominates another human think subjective thing based skills perceive never slick super athletic dexterous competitor anything always got outwork got outgrind got mean lived tend see beauty perceptual awareness people luxury slick athletic using beautiful technique said phenomenal little video day sent friend compilation foot sweeps leota machida mma beautiful awesome appreciation ca emulate lack physical ability whereas least chance emulate people grit outworking people would love return genghis khan get thoughts like many mixed feelings whether evil whether violence brought world ultimately fact maybe kind like dan carlin describes cleansed landscape like reset world violence ultimately progressive effect human civilization even though short term led massive could say suffering know make man thoughts genghis khan think always difficult look historical figure actions time modern day lens easy us impugn achievements things say oh well wrong well course true lot times actually real good context concept times living really deemed wrong really looking cushy modern lens said read genghis khan yeah violent dude also gave option got village said look choice come us run gave option join legion fighters took good care first military leader pay soldiers families died based booty got raided village took money took share divided amongst soldiers soldiers families think also credited first like horseback mail routes something like right godfather modern postal system something like yeah bernie sanders yeah yeah oh mongol empire think offering surrender interesting one interesting like thought experiment whether would sacrifice way like pride nations nationalism pride country whether willing give know survive depends depends family like young kids stuff like think obligation primarily therefore surrender something consider moment time take care people man alone got like principles stuff genghis khan selling yeah try escape thing know know waits side potentially think someone else depends obligation feels like historically people valued principles life weight like value principles hold versus survival seems value principles much principles could also religion could values whatever okay sort sacrificing preserve survival applies forms like actual survival like social media like preserving reputation kinds things seems like especially america value individual life death somehow really bad thing opposed saying sacrificing principles bad thing everybody dies okay die horrible sacrifice principles live another day think big problem people really even know principles anymore people know social media way live nowadays separated human contact like like contacting people community anymore whether religious like congregating church part parish like would like know south part community anymore difficult figure principles values constantly jumping one bucket next online get lot like direct like reasonable feedback people get dipshit feedback like oh believe well jerk think hard thing currently integrity character stick principles wan na equate murder genghis khan times social media cancel culture certainly feel good people attacking social media take lot integrity without anger without emotion without without mocking others attacking others unfairly standing ideas hold another way standing friends standing little group like loyalty people know good people find cancel culture one sad things whenever somebody gets quote unquote canceled everybody gets friends become really quiet defend worse mean quiet least understandable kind signal throw bus guess one way put something think lot coming like hold ethic know others hold ethic maybe russian mobster ethic like help friends bury body criticize friends committing murder certain levels like yeah discussion bury body maybe done murder thing know understand problematic terminology problematic ethical framework within operate time feels like else world except brotherhood sisterhood love small community perhaps wrong way thinking perhaps st century would defined dissipation community loyalty concept individuals think right think sort core framework principles beliefs operate think referencing little bit different speak point need framework core principles base lot decisions like believe three things true whatever help inform decisions make life far treat friends got probably three friends called right said let bury body sorry lex got ta go people life said hey got ta go bury body would say know think depends relationship really good measure would love would love profile people put like pronouns would love put like honestly like objectively objective many people life committed murder would ask questions would help hide body like would love know number people yeah think weird thing think right away like okay must group people closest first thinking right obviously like best friend would question got people close close ways probably would think yeah consideration guess principle friends think would underlying principle blind loyalty people life different reasons got people inner circle probably would help change tire morning highway called said hey got ta bury body might show weird different connections yeah fascinating yeah close friends like probably exactly tire good example like ca find somebody else think part leap faith like giving person creates deep connection makes life fulfilling like meaningful exist take leap mean murder sort focusing think think cross bridge get exactly sure thought experiment think lot especially covid times like people become isolated separated like important deep deep connections humans think especially like talking ever seen movie town great line movie one main characters walks friend house says need help gon na go hurt people never ask friend looks says whose car taking like type person need life people like people walk door say drop everything people walk door like know got hot pocket microwave little bit tied right love help know wan na deep connection people mentioned principles changed mind wan na go interesting principles process changing useful talk ca really cite specific thing except understanding principles different points life change okay change without total pussy bullied people thinking thought wrong come conclusions volition decide change great really liberating really liberating idea hold true core belief system actually someone change mind okay opposed like got ta die got ta die really liberating definitely ideas wan na die hill one ever gon na change mind really liberating confident enough say change mind lucky enough smart motherfuckers around tell listen total dipshit let rethink one friend five whys time loves backing corner five whys someone makes statement something really get core issue say ask five times make statement well answer well phrase whys differently obviously get core say five times get core issue challenging thing find later life liberating confident enough like man fucking way mark mind changed able say others wrong totally ability never used feels real good hunger yeah right actually personal level feels good exactly said liberating free think opposed defend yeah without thinking yeah get sick defending thing start think like well would really like evolve thought process constantly defending one point difficult let ideas discount possibility mind changed constantly defense crack front line order let new idea come possibly flourish maybe new idea even prove current belief system wrong maybe like water seed grows something even bigger better start work instead tough thing stubborn fuck difficult historically say wrong one messed one yeah wish could one back public figure thing difference changing mind small circle friends changing mind publicly something equal one echoes equally liberating people people make change easy matter point think ultimately liberating human public figure think deeply world keep changing like think deep hunger like political discourse people tribal currently politics want see somebody says know changed mind keep changing mind keep asking questions keep showing kind stuff want someone position political power change mind realize might better way realize changing mind gon na get new demographic vote like transparent shit nobody wants see like person ca separate position people supposed helping yeah usually smell talking offline something hillary clinton talked changing mind gay marriage felt like political calculation versus like really deeply thinking like know things world violate basic human rights like really thinking deeply know course politicians calculating see thing like human level like political policies also humans always liked bernie sanders example know later perhaps bernie sanders used listen back day felt people might disagree felt like real human struggling ideas whatever agree felt like political calculation human could away political ideals also like obvious authenticity passion saying present candidates could see people politics forever like way back hillary lawyer couple shots courtroom though looking right got big glasses kind little bit nerdy babe back day oh mean like yeah wow john clark says hillary clinton babe back day clinton yeah interesting question authenticity politicians think like hillary clinton clintons general good example think become time inauthentic system changes hunger power always inauthentic well first like say know know come bit political dynasty student government several times high school dad runoff special election bradenton beach florida think like people dad got job yeah basically lot people compare us kennedys guess politicians see becoming cognizant people political process think process corrupts people think know ins outs listened people far educated unprepared cite points think see little bit dan crenshaw say yeah like really liked dan especially like year year half ago seemed clear panders right setting presidential run clear happening seem like authentic ideals oriented guy year half ago could wrong could way think take someone honest want start path presidency become unbelievably beholden many people entities along way time get final destination oval office paying back favors got never get serve people supposed serve primary focus office people supposed helping think humongous problem could talk campaign finance reform two party system end day people running political posts working keep job working improve lives constituents different long long time ago lot politicians jobs held posts west ranchers day sheriff night whatever case might cushy path rest life goal politician things think politician supposed problem way talk dan podcast funny like version year ago really paying attention actually pay attention ask exact question like prevent changing becoming clintons became tend believe like conspiratorial stuff clintons politicians tend believe actually good thoughtful people back day point system changes even system something process campaigning think wears look percentage time spend kinds conversations like one speeches repeat thing beats process thinking exhaust brain thinking anymore repeating exceptionally difficult keep making speech speech speech saying thing time thinking deeply changing mind learning also pandering financial like phone calls like fundraising kinds things spend time fundraising worried anything sorry interrupt gon na say see fuel like attention higher regard held community sycophants continue blow smoke ass changes way present see every walk life mean tiny tiny little section world see community someone sudden starts social media page whatever get bunch people basically instagram page change fileting word think giving filet show yeah fileting yeah jamie look

worried oh really like commitment knocked ass want want things two alive points life think people feel alive feel euphoria new relationship loss love gone never feel think moments life see nice thing loss lasts longer yeah louis point makes like show think conversation older gentleman says like favorite part relationship period loss relationship real death forgetting person period lasts longest like fulfilling like missing person fulfilling actual like love early infatuation interesting also think bukowski return little clip interview saying love fog dissipates first light reality something like basically emphasizing fleeting thing moment thing fades everything else something else love temporary thing interesting think people say cynical know know think think important understand everything fleeting put effort almost everything fleeting put effort people get fat lazy put effort something gon na good playing guitar playing bass got put effort thing goes relationship awesome part love part dies soon early relationship good think work keep things got ta keep things new crisp fresh different people probably feel differently know walk around girl start farting stuff dies dies human beings bodies work way start chip away beautiful thing stop buck conventional courtesy things like take granted basically take granted yeah mean thing life big fan meditating death could die today way meditate relationship could end today connection another human could last time could interacting chances increase take granted shit people work chances decrease never gon na zero decreases person trying maintain trying work relationship got ta make sure people working otherwise fucking chump okay let return back mixed martial arts let ask ridiculous question think top three maybe top five greatest fighters time hard compare fighters across generations maybe one way say metrics would put table measure great fighter guy named dioxopus fourth century badass olympics bc one even showed fight pancreation event nobody even showed fucking everybody years later retired crazy macedonian dude came dinner alexander great everyone chilling drinking whatever drinking chalices macedonian dude threatened challenged dioxopus said yeah man throw set time place macedonian dude comes like body armor spear shield shit dioxopus came absolutely naked wooden club took much younger guy beat living crap put foot throat even kill show ultimate power time something guy naked extra demeaning extra demeaning yeah okay rephrase question clearly going probably forgotten warriors history well let take like modern day mixed martial arts ufc perhaps well mixed martial arts think top fighters time metrics would consider trying answer perhaps unanswerable question think one things wan na think strength opponent time fought example fighting bj penn prime beating far different beating bj penn last year right say victory bj penn given timeframe happened take anything away anyone beaten bj penn use example someone whose career went different direction would say guy think probably best people least familiar would murillo bustamante think guy one guys first really good physical build mma think narrow chest back long shoulder shoulder kind sinewy made steel cable guy could box guy could wrestle guy great jujitsu great kick boxer time need fought everybody gave everybody run think probably one guys got ta considered killers never cause like discussion cause like think greatness requires skill opportunity meet talk fighter thing really good fighter needs become great foil many fighters foil one biggest attractions think early mike tyson career foil one driving time time foil holyfield career different place one greats time never really foil greatness unparalleled destruction like nobody well lesser opponents right people debate level greatness mike tyson one things say like fight lot killers prime think obviously got say conversation really difficult time keeping george pierre conversation able beat anything could jab could wrestle could submit problem phaidor career also took drastic turn towards end fighting pride lot grappling started casting overhand right people game kind changed point ca take anything away greatness time great heavyweights really fighting pride really exist yet time fought really good one fabricio verdun get submitted later performance color perception greatness general fighters mine someone intimately involved sport colors everyone else anderson silva think anderson silva want fight seven years something guy prime one best fighters top five think probably top five yeah greater striker time mma mixed martial arts mixed martial arts tough question greatest mma striker time cause like timing talking foot sweeps right makes look easier anderson silva think incredibly short sample prime got ta anderson silva think consider discussing liotta machida unbelievable manipulation distance something people really talk much terms fighting unless someone sport use distance ability like call pop like make miss one inch could follow fist back retract hit top thing beauty anderson silva became counter striker got prime ufc thing beauty thing beauty think definitely two guys murillo bustamante got ta third guy many good guys put terms metrics mentioned gsb anderson silva think large number defenses title important like kind consistent domination easily manipulated people making money fights great quote one time ufc coming prominence vince mcmahon wwe said difference ufc superstar make sure stays top longer superstar predetermined results ufc ca actually fights well true false ca give superstars favorable matchups keep top longest people always talk title defenses guy fighting challenger always person deserving shot true put much stock possible put guy consideration one greats one two amazing fights tell like amazing could lot different definitions could war like never really reached highest excellences domination like discussion kyle bakhniak right yep perfect example famous fight zabit magomed sharapov one side anderson silva type fighter zabit like good striker like warrior kyle side fight created something special together fight night whatever fight special night two dance partners great performance without great fighter saying neither guys great fighter answer first question think one two great performances necessarily mean great need larger sample size idea idea also much weight toughness thinking criteria define great fighter good question answer admire underdog rises occasion brute force bring skill set table perhaps greats rose occasion mean something something talking like internal attributes opposed external physical attributes things think teach things come door either think talk time one things mind changes regularly like makes fighter born bred week opinion maybe suppress people tease think make someone seed think turn great warrior level grit mental toughness fight kyle fought zabeat unique situation guys kind later replacement fight kyle zabeat star rise kyle put blueprint beat zabeat pressure try drag late rounds notice later calvin cater fought would give five rounds wanted five rounds zabeat camp understand would agree would agree five round fight well look right kyle three round fight three round fight went decision went decision zabeat decision clearly kyle shot winning third round remember exact score kyle could third round done couple things differently believe fourth round think kyle would fourth round think maybe even fight would fifth round pressing forward perhaps funny way could tell wrong felt like emphasizing head movement point went full mike tyson point funny say contradiction actually mike tyson great head movement actually know exactly mean pocket think trying movement pocket pressing forward fuck attitude backing little bit later zabit back towards cage towards end round get fight said kyle like look kid training martial arts since three years old area gon na got ta channel grit know opportunity showcase know long kyle much shorter zabit good long training zabit even say anything clips mike tyson training tv gym head movement even mention started get talk getting inside length longer fighter things like kind people train mma say okay guy really good wrestler let think avoiding wrestling better wrestler think difference skill great wrong answer guy really good wrestler wants take lot wrestling experience probably gon na get got good coach deal say gon na learn eight weeks wrestle better guy wrestling since eight years old also bad idea concentrated camp worked beautifully getting caught chain wrestling takedowns gon na get caught get caught next step defending takedown one chain techniques gon na get fucked right talked ton work get ups breaking hands various takedowns ago remember exactly techniques worked concentrated defend first takedown stay chain get chained bunch wrestling techniques wrestled really successful third round zabit tired tired zabit got tired cuts tremendous amount weight like ca see staying forever start giving five round fights even know five round fight yet may ca see staying guy like guys giant guy kyle pressed forward said felt power left zabit hands felt fine think part fed crowd moved forward know saw taking lot damage like punches staying started walking right goes question makes fighter walking forward like something born something training mike tyson tv born kyle born crowd boston new york brooklyn lot arenas lot different sporting events one loudest things ever heard going crazy ask like taught kyle much like try tease pull back also technical wants emotion fun gets way technique probably cost couple wins one things work right like staying within professional taking time download information round one starting fight round two tension two things makes day created one opinion one greatest fights ever seen joe rogan agrees yeah one greatest fights certainly ever seen like funny coach see frustration like like throwing away strategy kind thing like seeing like happy could things could done win fight retrospect think time playing incredible house money like kyle gigantic underdog fight zabit unstoppable think people probably picking finish fight round one think point one ever gone distance zabit one certainly know put kind performance together think kyle kyle put blueprint retrospect look last round yeah things could done differently playing house money point like mean let fly get point got three rounds seconds left got move chips center table know see happens remember joe rogan said remember like got one think trouble remembering offline talked fight exceptionally impressed mean joe boston like mean story okay sucks naturally want romanticize like rocky versus like rocky four draga mean similar suppose kind chemistry kyle style represents american ideal right spirit yeah mean gloucester like could dragged docks three hours fight said hey want go fight would said yes oh man special fight per discussion like greatest fighters time tend believe fight special championship belt defenses george sanpere know something like rocky rocky one special like rocky three right like underdog whatever like dance partners like going war like moment mean bigger bigger individual fighter create know perhaps good career good like terms money terms longevity terms kinds things special moment history fighting created remember like right like much excitement air third round remember corner like

going hard fan moment stay within try like coach fuck even coaching point like rumbling got seconds trying win remember like performance fan moral victories ever gon na one one fight grabbed kyle like even center cage yet hugged said fucking hero remember emotional able part feels wrong say kind avoided saying think honest feelings safe space feeling yeah think greatest mixed martial arts fight ever seen think biased honestly thinking like biased honestly think think greatest fight like wan na rank fights ever seen think greatest fight ever seen certainly one greatest displays like dogged effort underdog experienced probably outsized mean like kyle one kids never gon na tell fight something ca teach seen tons people physical attributes mental midgets got million dollar body cent heart kyle ca teach matter would say like career combat sports spans wan na go way back like wrestling like one probably greatest experiences part bittersweet sport fickle mistress yeah mean tragic aspect like guess kyle lost right like look record kind things perhaps like look career maybe like financial financial perspective perhaps greatest thing kyle career history ufc perhaps maybe many people even watch fight special moment stands history many history fighting end day look someone career ufc financially handful people make real money everybody else makes nothing handful people make real money loss cost near term sure look back life gon na look back loss something derailed life financially never recovered gon na happen like sad thing unless champion people gon na forgotten right gone people forgotten forgotten certainly accolades gon na misrepresented either gon na inflated diminished one way looking back hard quantify experience moment one people intimately involved value experience supersedes financial gain would put khabib discussion greatest time recently worked together watched fight justin gaethje khabib retired would put one greatest never truly find foil like

gas know fix oil know fix flat tire comes short actually beyond nothing think oftentimes around long enough encounter like new wave like good grapplers interesting sometimes running systems realize running like like oh yeah trained marcello garcia academy long time big fan marcello student encountered lot auto style number years ago deep foot locking leg attacks whatnot long long time understand system better may let say understand system better would huge issue something encountered long time ago trying come trying utilize systems created let say hoffa mendez someone else basically trying good version well entirely predictable think big issue come back think systems lot times terms particularly end user type systems like iphone really really fast way able sorts things take could recreate want nsa less end user exactly exactly way listening want nsa combat right watching pee basically guess would come back say understand things interact fundamental level type games exist type interactions exist transcend lot systems almost like cook versus make certain things kitchen chef could give bunch ingredients could probably cook well couple different things master chef would aware implications things extra time oven less time oven putting flavoring spice various things also could turn ingredients chinese food could turn ingredients italian food could turn italian food ingredients chicken parmesan could turn lasagna limited specific thing knowledge food interacts create taste create texture come back let take rock paper scissors rock paper scissors built idea couple different things actually tell may ask question favorite dinosaur three go one two three oh man gon na best friends okay first question say hey let play rock paper scissors like hey rock paper scissors rock paper scissors shoot like rock paper scissors shoot like okay go rock paper scissors shoot like oh man got lucky imagine times row luck luck honestly let say instance go rock paper scissors go shoot rock paper scissors shoot comes rock right lose whose fault built parody thing get pick second get pick second like able investigate background going meet like oh hi oh love new jersey nets statement one right mind would ever make growing anyway personal knowledge somebody anyway come back understand games structured start realize huge gaps huge holes lot thinking behind create illusion choice play one mind one favorite ones class time seen okay may ask questions please sure okay fantastic scared everybody wins worry right could please win could please pick three fingers tell thumb okay pinky okay middle finger okay could please pick two fingers middle finger pinky okay could please pick one finger go middle finger woohoo okay could please pick one finger pinky okay let play pick one finger please middle finger okay pick one finger please thumb yeah pinky okay pick two fingers please middle finger ring finger okay could please pick one finger damn thought enhanced illusion choice illusion choice asking questions provided ask right questions correct answer mean ultimately wanted let say like thought guiding something wanted turns outcome wanted gon na ask wrong questions might get wanted oh way sergeant dropped people might listening matter trajectory took decision tree ryan presenting always ending middle finger ironically enough surprised us surprised winners yeah everyone felt like winner right gon na ask different questions mind please pick two fingers put middle finger pinky right sorry oh awkward like worst finger positions okay please pick wait minute ow hold yeah well pick two fingers put thumb pinky okay thumb pinky please pick two fingers put well whatever two like okay middle finger pointy finger ah okay pick two fingers put name index finger index finger right call pointy finger pointy one one usually point weird point ring finger uh sorry two put please middle finger ring finger ah man pick ring finger index finger yeah yeah aha woohoo win even though asking questions impossible arrive good outcome longer guaranteed went situation literally ca lose yeah pretty low probability right super low probability second realize would never let win ball truly court guess kind fundamentally trying put play almost time ask right set questions develop ability courage constitution ability discipline necessary patience necessary ask proper questions wait proper answers assuming like perfect world win period make sense yeah totally makes sense know know sort mathematical discipline game theory something called mechanism design game theory field model kind interaction human beings model grappling way model nuclear conflict nations way set set rules incentives use math predict likely outcome depending time based interaction given rules mechanism design design games like design systems likely lead certain outcome suggesting want create want discover systems whose decision tree possible things could happen feel like choice made ultimately one parties choice actual final outcome making feel like playing game like feel trapped kind well best traps look threatening like oh walk guess kind interesting thing lion lion roar interesting thing watch lions hunting roar hunt want move back stuff like actually want come get pretty slinky like water covered like furry water guess keep mind funny us hobby actually brilliant guy one mma coaches head coach tristar brought one time thought really salient point said let say million person bracket impossibly huge frank dukes winning kumite level huge bracket claimed knock like consecutive people like hong kong thing everyone kept mouth shut anyway pretty cool come back little improbable pretty cool let say instance cheating going cheating going flipping coins right someone gon na unbroken string victory bracket pretty insane many consecutive person end imagine like aliens show go hey wan na flip coin whether earth gets continue like oh good would tempting person like lucky guy sure mean maybe effectively could argue effectively incredibly lucky basically actual ability like perk video game thing happened anyway many times someone could go entire career particularly fight sport well let say get knockouts scenarios cause see happening time fight game scenario like mounted scenario many many many many many striking scenarios lot grappling ones tons striking scenarios dead somebody wins knockout win five times row lose couple times row go happened like mean happened always flipping coin win five go ah back track imagine flipping coin heads heads heads heads tails tails heads oh man back flipping good basically going think vast majority time humanity tendency see sign almost anything starts present build narrative mind convince sort control reality marginal situation best whole time yeah without much control without deep understanding system stories told stock market many distributed human systems start telling narratives start seeing patterns without understanding actually system generating patterns see system incredibly valuable go well system systems guess maybe physics maybe something like game theory explains things guess aspects system put hands touch understand missing going world around continue lean dune talk blind person world sight talk someone everyone got coronavirus one taste smell like delicious like anyway senses missing understanding missing preventing seeing dots connect world around think sometimes oftentimes least personally screwed lot nose deep trench trying understand ca take step back realize forest headbutting tree may maybe two things true would say comes strategy trying understand also go well okay well sounds cool actually say really good question imagine say man fight like steven thompson fight like wonder boy like good idea go like guy would fight like kameem abagamadov could seems work anyway go well could develop could take time developing skills strategies become apparent executable actually ability like person arena person required whereas plenty great ideas like dunking basketball fantastic idea alas unless small trampoline nearby guy make less good idea developed ability lack ability anyway think lot times least watch people fighting use example concerned trying win early rather develop skills going like well best way fight current set skills usually path forward like barbarian route like put one ring take damage need take hit guy something realized early mma career like good striking time striker way better striking given credit helps people sleep night think serious yeah yeah always introduced like master master grappler like nice say maybe good grappling even seen funny thing like cause people almost go like well lex see really good got ta understand equal man good thing maybe really good mediocre also possible plenty people define striker lack options cause really good striker like grappler grappler blue belt really anyway guess come back constantly going win got right think oftentimes never take time develop skills wan na develop also never take time develop strategies wan na develop actually one big blessing fighting someone frequently really frustrating result injuries time away people hesitant get game gives much time trenches focus developing abilities almost like developing money like mentioned stock market put imagine told bitcoin great idea five years ago eight bucks man someone told bitcoin great idea five years ago k like oh god sleeping bed money would set fire later today due injuries mining bitcoin time rich man well actually someone told trying mine bitcoin actually like cave found recently actually mining like figure speech misunderstood like literal thing mean defense know mean english language difficult really next time talk explain russian rich language learn russian help believe thank whirlwind overview career mma leading point injuries undefeated record next since topic first fight blue belt training year half nine tournaments weekends maybe eight tournaments weekends prior first fight april got punched face whole bunch realize professional fight found

good still shockingly good jeopardy anyway years later met faraz zahabi actually john danaher met john danaher put touch faraz zahabi started training tristar immediately loved working faraz learning faraz started training tristar first real professional mma fight someone actually practiced little bit prior think august guy four five time experience good kind like first go honestly fight tko little bit time another fight tough guy named majid hamo five two time think three amateur good little bit fighting experience one first round weird naked choke started experience difficulty getting fights point continuously introduced like master grappling submission least thing know source fear people think mean definitely much striking point definitely lot like think pretty hard hurt although try lean played baseball like years hit things pretty hard able recognized pretty early idea actually hit things hard without becoming hittable think kind big thing lot times like almost mentioning try go get people early hit good going get hit making basically making wager making trade life ability hit watch guys like israel adesanya floyd mayweather steven thompson conor mcgregor fighting really well trade hitting hitting hitting takes years years years years able learn ton lee another great example closest training partner one best friends currently one champion one championship asia champion featherweight guess lightweight featherweight recently defeated martin nguyen really great fight ton knocked long time champion ton let hit let touch feel fortunate met guys like steven ton go early career go holy moly ca even even like oh let walk find like fighting ghost periodically shows hammer smokes melon disappears ether way approach fighting game thinking attack without hit every strategy every idea going minimizing reverse absolutely mean good fighting done poor fighting throughout course history generals whether saw read battles attrition like yeah man got guys got like yeah guys die killing great great guys died hope worth realize kobe bryant phil jackson got everything got run across beach normandy better make sure thought like hey way walk around side huh oftentimes

back giving best effort want fight beat magomed sharapov want fight yagi rodriguez want fight korean zombie b complicated man yeah would fun would love see fight fascinating fight would fun would challenging guys challenging look forward staying healthy extent coming back going fight multiple times year hell high water hell yes hey way completely forgot talking systems decision trees illusion choice made think sam harris forgot mention talks free quite bit huh illusion free bold claim cotton know maybe universe constructed little game makes us feel like bunch choices really really always ending middle finger would hilarious yeah see die giant middle finger like oh fuck knew think think free like feel like making choices thinking talking okay system martial arts hands graceful different schools whatever thinking okay think outside systems also system human society feel like actual choice made us individuals think choice real illusion well okay really good question necessarily equipped answer best okay guess would say start sure would interesting real choice real yeah would pretty interesting real first would start facilitated beliefs versus facilitated beliefs almost like think world get true true next probably facilitated belief even imagine believe free okay justify every single impulse going give belief free belief ability work hard focus disciplined improve position improve situation whether true although think least many us would argue least whether sort internal driver allows yeah like live material world actions affect world choose pick water anyway would say belief strongly idea picking facilitated beliefs going hey adjust whether belief system right wrong cosmic level nowhere near smart enough understand say deciding let say instance gon na walk conversation someone hotel lobby never met go start oh gon na interesting walk versus head like asshole want two different conversations could right person polite thinks negatively right go think probably facility believe people talk gon na help navigate conversation positive conclusion think let say fighting good example like confidence plenty people believe plenty things real included sure time anyway believing something like hey think win guarantee positive outcome would say us would probably us would argue helps thinking believing depression negative unfacilitated belief always oftentimes reflected reality project onto reality understandable makes feel like oh man gon na work think prospects going well feel like ca get loop seems pretty rough see lot things society right go whether agree disagree various positions things go facilitative belief even true arguable anything next man end positive happy ending go well happy ending like okay choose facilitative belief intuition believing free real productive successful life absolutely otherwise first society function real blame anyone else hold anyone responsible anything free real well exactly point surface level saying true perhaps truly internalize free illusion start figure something transforms way see society example believing free real puts lot responsibility blame people something bad maybe truly internalize free illusion start think system humans together like mechanism progress opposed individual people responsible actions good bad like remove value weight assign accomplishments violence negative stuff done individuals look progress society know looks like almost like opposed focusing individual ants ant colony looking entirety ant colony think makes perfect sense would say reasonable thing suggest seismic shift right hard say whether would better worse guess use convenient one remember last time spoke brought one reviled evil characters certainly recent history probably human history period adolf hitler well big fan making people live world wan na believe well free exist things move forward gon na guy like know cause remember said know actually brings something else discussed know yeah people know ryan brought brought literally giant book hitler obsessed hitler world war ii stalin recently recently oh man become like meme joe rogan like dmt hitler pick something positive cat hat something know brought hitler example something particular philosophical discussions excellent eloquent full integrity mma journalist clipped something said hitler said know forget headlines ridiculous possible implementation basically intentionally misunderstanding saying like get stupid stupid know like lot sympathy yeah exactly yeah exactly ca keep passing basically intentionally misunderstanding going find funny hey got ta careful believe back cancel culture thing discussed last time well would like apologize mean actually something cancel culture seeing things culturally like damned apologize anything need apologize intentionally misunderstood instance could say necessarily historical scholar would agree immediately also oftentimes eloquently articulately phrase things agree ultimately going hey wan na make believe live world suggesting ought exist okay free everything far step back willing take cosmically start going hey good experiencing social reckoning country moment good probably guess basically hey worked right probably something would fly think fair thing interesting might fly individual perspective zoom think appreciate society like ant colony beautifully complex system like kinda individual perspective value progress especially progress individual whole progress societies accept complex system necessarily headed anywhere almost like river flowing think removes burden always striving always trying always like struggle possible control like arrive kind zen state sound human though goes think current human condition experience communicated like taught like social forces taught lives matter maybe convince sort like little things stream ultimately none matters might kind enjoyment discovered process listen capitalist rah rah like guess think bringing really important point guess almost anything like capitalism get experience sit get live raised united states traveled around world little bit good fortune meeting many people many different places end user capitalism really know got whether start idea hey come idea arrive nowhere near well read enough understand really even secondhand guess recognizing communism marxism socialism anarchism anything perspectives guess various strengths weaknesses guess one thing always guess would say burden seems wan na make change burden proof person implying needs change mean nothing like wan na create small shift ripple fine seismic ripping shift exist experience world human beings mentioned fighting watching someone undergo take abuse level ring shocking triumph spite like like unbelievable part magic combat sports part magic side magic get talked sometimes trajectory individual life later always great little phrase cost remember mentioned removing struggle personally struggle makes life life also guess something faraz brought number occasions makes sense basically humans understand things relative comparison understand heat known cold understand guess like like talking someone never experienced sort hardship latte right pitch fit versus someone gone great deal challenge struggle life tend little bit even perspective anyway course even relative thing perceive even may even maybe particularly soft something direction without realizing understand understand idea want fundamentally alter species people seems like incredibly incredibly high bar prove also like incredibly dangerous idea always comes back going responsible gets choosing good idea good idea guess actually brings kind something encountering recently discussions friends feel like two types people encounter point people less libertarian tilt thinking people without say libertarian mean political party sense even belief system basically like hey buddy concern versus concern guess always watched various points history people side people side less guess problematic guess could say mean internet sense issue world always full people want tell need opposed less harm guess one ones anytime trying tell people better hope right bizarre many people confident side position one right right enough enforce others seems incredibly dangerous guess comes back even sam point oh want trying spread idea free exist saying damaging maybe plenty things could well goes way head implications guess us evangelist something guess weird gotten far species wan na take like sharp sharp turns well taking bunch sharp turns throughout history yeah true way okay humans love power one way attain power say everything guys wrong right thing gon na build giant cult people gon na overthrow indirectly results gaining power get big revolutions human history saying done thing powerful currently gon na overthrow probably identity politics happening people power looking gain power also jordan peterson criticized identity politics people right good intentions say seeking power allow power corrupt power always lose track like devils fighting becoming kind devils kind evil fighting progress human history hopefully power greedy people keep attaining power progressive mindset time things get better better like generation generation lot unfairness happens lot hypocrisy happens lot people trampled along way mean well time like lessons learned like human civilization accumulates lessons part learns lessons history gets better better time even though short term people acting best selves know seems progress human history idea internalizing free real actually making realize ultimately leads kind go nihilistic direction yeah nihilistic wan na make political system like communist type system like value individual completely reduced removed another perspective like freedom individual valued protected current perspective systems seem worked united states works pretty damn well despite different criticisms seems like freedom individual forms seems fundamental success united states however hell put like matter whether free illusion belief real protects individual group fundamentally correct wrong always seems like big issue history hey deal like yikes wan na wan na different wan na different religion wan na different skin color wan na bad tribal things happen correct wrong yeah yeah absolutely always fundamental power balance though right well interesting thing libertarian thinking guess know words maybe charged know yeah charged may scale mean like philosophical underpinning like yeah basically hey feel free believe fool plenty people sure long chase hall hit back head textbook big deal yeah libertarian viewpoint probably espouse much like freedom individual valuable like leave others fuck alone unless trying hurt thing also believe put work empathy understanding others leaving people fuck alone means others interesting thing believe freedom individual take like like said take past first question ask many times extend respect respect position respect individual lived experience could grossly different mine yeah problem saying individual gon na bother bother like actionable make actionable think steps beyond think actually mean means understanding even existence like hurts others understand like sitting alone room using like public transit using police force using firefighters using like using lot resources publicly shared resources unfairly distributed like agreed gon na pay taxes taxes gon na go towards building kind infrastructure already towards social real real sort like talk michael ballas like anarchist right saying like basically full leave fuck alone going collaborate whoever hell want american society stands currently agreed going sort certain social institutions pay sort discussions race kinds things institutions institutionally unfair whether race gender kinds things listen know bunch criticisms way conversation carries thing valuable actually listen empathize often talked leave fuck alone mindset little component think could fundamental function society like social like obama build build alone whatever however goes basically would able accomplish anything individuals without help others able start think okay duty responsibility human beings respectful loving help part functioning society starts actually lot work start think like think okay ryan life like like business owner covid like employees run gym like stress like fighting injury like empathy takes lot like compute cycles fairly also lot energy right go computation want individual like hurt may guess like come back muhammad ali one things said service others rent rent pay know price pay rent earth one things think see result internet time people talking global giant problems social problems massive like truly massive frankly beyond beyond power us solve certainly individual level know discussed things friends like father environmental attorney like know long time engineer long time know barely know anything reading little bit various things climate change oh god concerned climate change like supposed climate change tell litter try conserve energy whatever want personally giant social problem start control like well decent people around mention demonstrate empathy demonstrate consideration people circle extent people outside circle yelling trees things problems borderline cosmic seem productive makes feel like cool important talking something well hundreds years water rise maybe maybe wo ca completely head know nothing focusing problems actually solve comes back thing wan na win fight would love win fight ca control control individual step take around ring try make next correct move ca look gets people get excited trying keep language check get excited thinking problems superman could solve problems could powerful ca make bad things go away absolutely change think lot lessons good lessons religion happened good lessons great men women throughout history inspired talk change starting within treating people around decently treating people around decently even necessarily mean golden rule unto others would like go well maybe would like person would like thing well gon na get bottom could attempting decent person standard decent maybe missing mark well ca possibly interacted like like someone talking nonsense microaggression like let get straight never met never met interpreting minor comment made least charitable way possible saying could annoyed expectation level consideration gon na disappointed lot someone life consistent basis like hey really appreciate saying realize perceiving go oh man sorry course would hear say guess trying recognize guess job treat others dignity general level specificity requires increases gets closer person finite amount resources financially intellectually emotionally physically chuck every single different direction like people like oh care deeply tibet like go build house man get plane go build house oh wan na really wan na post facebook accept high fives much good guy got idea go help somebody neighborhood go play kids go friend someone friend read book try educate guess come back problems solvable grand scale almost like attempting address personal lives better rather giant airing grievances consistent basis sometimes necessary valuable air grievances go hey sort next step guess trying address giant social level seems unmanageable even best intentions yeah mean nevertheless lot social networks mean enjoy tweeting consuming twitter apply exact principle said free discussion like approach way get stuck loop counterproductive try things productive like said like kind things world whether tweeting building things low effort tweeting actually building businesses building ideas high effort actually solve problems way approach wonder possible scale encourage approach social media communication fellow humans way know think would done guess like improve quality discourse maybe like even like said empathy decency discourse think people incentivized encouraged think see happening twitter facebook small powerful implementation details goes like source dopamine rush like button sharing mechanisms even small tweaks fix lot really believe like lot stuff see result initial implementation systems anticipate modernization comes engagement tools clicking like sharing always obvious obvious beginning obvious twitter facebook grew big dopamine rush getting followers likes shares gotten addicted feeling like many people commenting many people saying like clicking like dopamine rush want say thing get likes mass society thing expected controversial divisive get likes initial mechanisms likes shares resulting outcome unpredicted huge amounts division irrespective like basics human connection actually come understand society valuable individual level like saying mass results like throw divisive scale course think could fixed incentivizing personal growth like incentivizing challenge grow individual importantly happy end day feed like incentivize feeling good way long lasting think makes people actually feel good kind others feels good getting lot likes think different incentives implemented correctly could build social networks would much better think comes structural perspective guess point mention like mentioned free also mentioned feeling good working hard know guess race goggins thing yeah four four challenge run four miles every four hours two days awesome yeah bunch challenge running running tough mostly sleep deprivation training every four hours struggle right struggle struggle gives meaning ultimately guess mentioned like said adjusting things like guess like programming level almost based programming level interface different user point user responsibility man woman person behave decently guess utilize seems like society grossly missing like martin luther king right like great inspiring characters throughout american history throughout world history great leaders leadership part know definitely great leaders good question question political systems pushing forward great leaders also okay basic engineering shit ryan room alone talking even strangers incentives us get along like together person saying even saying kind profound remove remove implementation social networks stand right digital space different set incentives fun destroy others shitty others becomes loop endless loop like saying ultimately destructive productive think interfaces making feel good nice others currently feel nearly good nice others internet feel nearly bad real life shitty others internet incentives wrong think technology solution least solution improve communication mechanism obvious bunch sort detailed ideas fascinating gotten chance talk jack dorsey quite bit ceo twitter legitimately conversation would agree everything good human lot really good ideas improve things question captain ship whether even question whether ceo even captain much actually steer ship gotten large enough much momentum many users many people marketing pr lawyers difficult change things difficult fallout difficult actually like literally power power weird large organization great leaders great leaders whether presidents leaders companies steve jobs would argue musk way walk room full people want create drama weird man people kind want nice niceness creates momentum nobody wants systems thing everybody behaves way previously behaving way supposed behave nobody wants raise fuss takes great man woman leader step say bullshit okay fired cool right yeah think create constant revolutions within company difficult structurally psychologically difficult able sort yeah constantly challenge way things done past another way often done startup like small company basically small company becomes really successful longer turn ship new startup comes along new competitor challenges big ship starts winner like google came twitter came facebook apple know dream steve jobs would succeed many decades like centuries idea would keep creating revolutions steve jobs apple successfully pivoted bunch times like reinvented difficult mean least know accurate would know anything heard plenty people complain steve jobs reality reason amazing things done person willing well obviously brilliant also willing rattle everyone cage periodically say hey going need really interesting thing would rattle cage also know intricately connected always connected would dick maybe standard lazy worthless well would say dick though standard mean like like everyone stupid compared somebody know guess apparently able take kind thing sometimes cross ways cross line mean okay fascinating thing leader especially leader companies people problem individual room leader really interactive small number people leaders smaller groups individuals room different psychology like pushed limit like screamed soft spoken almost afraid speak hear like could superstars talking like c students talking plus students well funny yeah thing manage skill manage people completely separate skill innovate something mean connected funny almost like know shitty shitty representatives yeah well mean thing get elected nothing governance yes know well exactly great leaders skills like boldness look great presidents history usually time crisis step basically say okay stop old way congress works bickering like compromise bullshit huge plan costs billions dollars today age trillions dollars extra pork extra additions like clear plan going build best road network world ever seen going build huge infrastructure project going revolutionize internet oh going coronavirus going build largest like testing facility world ever seen terms going get everybody tested several times day kinds things huge projects say fuck details everybody bickering going give everybody give everybody like huge projects time boldness leadership saying throw bullshit past time able get room leaders parties powerful individuals smooth talk shit way need smooth talked like skills seems combined one person creates great leaders musk appears elon know steve jobs interesting criticism steve little bit elon misses human part maybe impossible really like sadiq nadal ceo microsoft really good human side really really good human side like everybody loves ceo google alphabet also way way know possible get many stat points yeah get rpg life right got good jiu jitsu fast went mean told story blue belt went black belt really quickly terms ranks terms skill level mean go black belt nearly fast skill set developed like extremely well high level competition good person ask one get good jiu jitsu talked solving problems elite level beginner martial arts get good much training basic stuff like much training much drilling mental stuff like mind approach mental perspective tell perspective one guess would say feel step one feel lucky found good training situation particularly time drilled ton drilled drilled drilled drilled drilled one thing really important understand though able relatively brief period years go zero reasonably good think probably crammed hours small years people training let say two three times length may masquerade something else could say put hours yeah way around think put hours said drilling break apart little sure drilling look like recommendations make absolutely step one would say choices matter like think one really important things think consider lot junk system right like exploded terms number positions techniques strategies rule sets really cool one hand hand probably metric shit ton suboptimal things taught included taught things looking back five years three years two years one year like oh would like anymore straight sometimes would like times would literally never even particular movement think shrimp real move mean giant spiel seizure show person long story short lot things think fundamental think really pretty negative also heresy shrimp exactly like holy worship shrimp love shrimp love shrimp people shrimp scoot butt away opponent yeah would describe like really athletic looking position look like someone trying stick butt instagram push hands away expose face lay side someone told look like guess look like shrimp yeah like time someone really credible told drink unleaded gasoline got point life next best thing needed really improve life stop drinking unleaded gasoline would say lot stuff step one like junk actual junk waste time like albatross hanging affects think things going forward although funny like operating assumptions work huge huge huge influence mentioned like growing united states capitalist society like woohoo right course think really know different otherwise think lot times people go oh communism better like seen read books would better possible mean experienced much either ca dismiss outright guess would say fundamentally different operating system underpinning choices honestly believed thing many choices moment moment day day certainly lifetime basis would different would say tough young martial arts mean us always trying best learn young martial arts always go reasonable guy call like dunning kruger amnesia ca remember right one basically go like oh know say right read new story baseball like know anything baseball sounds credible bullshit ca call bullshit reasonable person ca call bullshit things understand even suspect right like well got reserve judgment never ever ever set aside need also obligation understand ask ask thing oh well want shrimp make space want make space get away guy well want get away well dangerous well dangerous oftentimes get wait minute even need move three quarters time actually acting person guess lot times ca kind goes beyond demonstrate would say trying understand base operating assumptions consistently reevaluate fricking exhausting frankly also comes confidence destroying mentioned pretty well relatively quickly started abu dhabi adcc first time alternate match black belt world champion fact frankly fact able beat someone like neat time says little bit issues cool really happen think like okay champion ostensibly high level sport enjoy three inch four inch height advantage pound weight advantage got beat like dead serious exist happens wrong right wrong enough variance way allowing win happen win heel hook basically one early examples like hey guys way people try hurt legs something like mentioned john danaher mentioned like know dean lister lot guys hensel gracie team amazing success gone done great things craig jones competitive grappling world basically taking advantage good also glaring glaring glaring issue operating system know huge vulnerability lower body attacking idea one attack means ca understand someone assail anyway guess come back absence knowing try polish got got knife like know use like okay gon na sharpen edge polish make sure need use dang thing able trying put together system idea going lot times end making choices long consistently reevaluating something tried time try seek best also articulate insightful instructors people various levels matter could say hey ryan think think think ever done martial arts try treat people respect honestly try demonstrate appreciation many many people helped time type person wan na train type trained people make us think beating crap never wanted guy basically saying like train black belt blue belt person enjoys training interest selfishly want beat selfishly mentioned decent people wan na incentivize decent people right structure selfishly incentivized nice guy even internally scumbag like think basically going like hey guy way likely help person way likely help shake hand say thank really appreciate helping thing tap four five times gon na ask tell obligation say whether tell thank much time really appreciate know okay summarize way brilliantly described wan na make sure keeping track went place pretty point first thing basically difficult wonder break apart little bit trust authority essentially keep asking respectful without trusting authority right right second thing kind person others like training around sort good friend many people enjoy around one yeah right attention completely disrespect way things done asking constantly one flaws understanding fundamentals described get good enough understanding like going fact instructor understand inability understand saying though invalidate something like mentioned like keeping mind flaws also flaws us instructor point guess speak kind weird like sit corner everyone little bit different people terribly popular high school like high school much anyway gon na rude people though never gon na bully anybody said hello say hello back would hold door walked would say simple things like go long long long way actually takes us back social discussion like oh man become great like well start pissing person beat crap disrespecting person probably closest thing font knowledge time recognizing virtue right thing try treat people decently beyond even selfishly interest see thing interesting culture martial arts culture like instructor legitimately carries aura authority comfortable really ask skill able discussion white belt black belt instructor done way saying skill show actually legitimately curious passionate compassionate student versus somebody annoying dick saw stuff youtube line walk wonder drilling thing example coming much emphasis placed clothes guards example might actually teach know like need master clothes guard clothes guard top bottom bottom really fundamental basics decided body body says wrong short legs even matter length legs something understand leverage works particular body feel thing feels like basic understanding leverage movement timing feels like certain like butterfly guard even like half basically every guard except clothes guard play dance clothes guard feels like shutting play wrong make sure want almost like innate characteristic guard position sold way like hey good guard like hey man bow arrow versus know use thing right like make sure far away like hill something cause take bow arrow run something try use nobody told told foundational foundational important everything else right back shrimping thing many things taught even let say garbage thing might effectively garbage could give ferrari try make fly gon na work like plane another plane another plane another plane ferrari like oh must different type plane like forgiven leap going like oh maybe wings come go fast enough take bullet make crazy leaps mind people time provide context worse yet provide improper context like much problem gon na well think skill white belt nice complicated human space intention least big picture view good question always intention good actual implementation good might almost much case much case white belts even know intention might good know lines crossing actually able like interpret ways totally insensitive requests others like explicit requests others job beginner really good listener social cues well like visitor foreign country right yeah like representative people look like people talk like people passport like man gon na go oh got foot knee well certain country world rude like oh sorry imagine someone says hey really appreciate take foot pretty rude wan na tell well man house better might go direction let say could get away bully ca get away maybe wrong side something guess like said positive intention fine also recognize think one thing tried continue try time like oh man hi one asking favor spar raymond daniels raymond daniels favor ai favor let get twisted thank much time really appreciate like effected nonsense serious like thank spar stephen thompson one done favor george pierre takes time spar past even kill really appreciate sit george prop get rocks see going also gon na expect take seen gentleman seen people get nuts george like patient saint level patience would say come back figuring like hey role comes back like least see people internet yeah man beef joe rogan like ryan goof like random dude joe like people want almost wan na like elevate somehow level peers go faraz zahabi gym peer faraz zahabi student tristar guest academy faraz asked something short like telling try triple backflip break neck answer yes sir faraz man worries hopefully come guess level graciousness guess kind one things see nowadays accessible people cause grew know big huge base sports fan kinds could send darajit message much less possibility reply like know people send messages nice people send messages people everyone everyone coming place plenty things like yo dude need like well tell never gon na happen idea addressed need oh man greatest one weird two cause hey ryan hey think could following get second like get second dang right easy ask started level politeness guess like maybe like grew virginia yes sir yes like goes long way different kinds implementations politeness mean successful people met surprising much mentioned peers like could think joe rogan mentioned joe rogan elon musk like almost treat like superior know mean even politeness like approach feeling like student beginner like approaching situation like almost like method acting like better approach lot interactions like something learn even like young think ungenuine totally genuine funny thing like spite incredibly genuine respect correct wrong respect obviously bring table approach everybody like right sure respect bring table beyond though treating dignity human yeah human right could probably get away treating people without whole heck lot dignity guess always say like like always tell someone quality treat king janitor way seeing lot like guess mean like nitpick take issue guess little bit disagree next question gon na criticize internet know give people internet oh man yells clouds anyway guess mean like way people address casual yes great one hand nice hand go hey ca somehow worried diminishing like way sure people talk like talk women sometimes yo girl oh man bitch versus like supposed get good response going elicit favorable response versus anything anything yo man going guess make sense makes total sense southern thing referring feel like important important part human communication let ask sure new back attacks instructional first awesome yeah second drop lot fascinating insights quote galileo people saying ca teach man anything help find within talked start jujitsu zoom even learn learn optimize learning process know answer tell like would say like ca step one maybe little bit easier never ton friends honestly got close friends people know never tons tons people spent lot time thinking anyway ca control ca control anybody else know want take marcus aurelius thing like know guess trick life figuring control focusing things control guess step one figuring internally also world pertains jujitsu actually control like passing someone guard control people think ai ca activity unchecked ai control entirely always breathe always know calm always matter whether concerned concerned whatever want call nerves know step forward across line say face challenge ahead entirely one stop entirely control know every single time walk ring walk head high fight everything ca promise win would say take first principles mentioned last time talked know elon importance going first principles guess come back lot times opinion things people think basics basics ca learn think reasoning first principles actually like level six actually like layers making many many baked assumptions going gon na struggle understand anything actually happening internally externally name guess would start comes learning first principles trying understand going also simple things first control posture control breathing one stop control place frames control place limbs move feet develop ability things better course practice drilling watching people incredibly fortunate time martial arts train many heroes train many people looked like guy amazing wan na train person steven thompson kenny florian george pierre raymond daniels faraz zahabi mean like bruno frizzato marcelo garcia guys unbelievable go well moving way different well well sometimes ask tell directly times people part genius intuitive maybe think understand see world way something experienced marcelo amazing different way see things fundamentally differently experience world differently seems taught really important lesson wanting trained someone go hey ryan works like right understood martial arts time ready someone tell like hey feels little bit like kind kind marcelo would time less experienced teacher completely could separate mind performance understanding thought understand could would also struggle sometimes wonder could execute things thought understood guys like marcelo elemental mean like like lightning wind like type thing like touch wanted capabilities could summon powers could always guess recognizing one way top mountain also lot science lot art science say lot art meeting people like marcelo taught josh waitzkin actually brilliant guy chess champion former owner maybe owner marcelo academy really great friend think book learning yeah art learning actually yeah knows thing two great guy anyway sat one time like look man wrong missing missing genius brilliance right front took long time mean frustrated inability grasp certain things sometimes teaching style different wrong tough time trying replicate marcelo saying opposed understanding fundamentals coming right could see coming also sometimes like well ca explain way would want explain like well ca meet coming anyway really important time lesson frustrating honest thankful time anyway always first principles trying understand basics first starting place control things basic elements work mentors teachers meet coming meet extent rather like like talking way want talk opposed hey coming back point yeah know entirely specific focus back whole ca teach man anything marcelo teach anything taught people like find within like guess something else heard learning performance always thought marcelo brilliant master letting inside consistent performances lot times felt like block personally particularly end think focus ideal definitely place would like whether would lost hard say know would performed better adjusted anyway recognizing think said study science express art matter articulate know matters know matters guess teaching verbal fashion actually articulate recognizing difference learning intellectual level conceptual level able translate physical guess thing feel fortunate time academy able kind fiddle around learn practice students sometimes struggled great training partners like say great training partner mean people spar roll gotten lot honestly ever would thought able practice learn fail try succeed without like little sandbox figuring take idea come drills drills practice actually practice putting play knowing idea drilling well point never never see light day dvd instruction dvd sorry online instructional dvd keep saying dvd though nobody dvds anymore like vhs know dvds like possess dvds mean never watched use like cup like cup like thing put drink mean pinch yeah even called coaster yeah matrix coaster matrix coaster zeros ones okay instruction people get watching really enjoying even know came recently right like december something like yeah part one actually ended like hours long like oh god got chop half comes together whole thing hope people like yeah well even part one really good actually yeah yeah people reddit really excited part two well really also back oh old one old one really helpful understand basic aspects control back really yeah know clicked instructionals things watched ever clicked definitely taught one thing know drop lot sort bombs drop lot really interesting details funny specific things really click like lot rings true kind take like oh interesting okay yeah certain things really click remember first instruction click like importance remember anymore like communicated integrated mine know mean describing upper body control importance upper body control back like certain grip like describe different details grips started trying realized important upper body control versus like maybe blue belt something thought like achieved victory got two hooks realized like least hooks even body type style way approach things even important supplemental part yeah points establish huge amount control fact hooks talking like illusion choice almost made people panic lot like fighting establishing kind control lot less panicked hooks involved even though lot panicked anyway realized lot kinds things especially judo much judo ground centered around aggressive efficient fast choking like different kinds clock chokes kind stuff brilliant thing gon na start make way coming like judo style approach like clock choking triangling top turtle stuff powerful something judo emphasizes obviously due rules urgency techniques go fast thing guess emphasizes judo really transition like person flying air easiest time mean like ryan hall type shit like put submissions positional control air could would right oh well throw well well learn throw think mean transition flying easiest time put stuff think chokes throwing thinking choke everything becomes lot easier ever see flavio canto man brazilian judoka cool like stuff like yeah exactly first starting principle like stop thinking game standing ground start thinking like standing standing comes ground comes everything happens transition well also attacking art war like like everyone like oh yeah art war oh yes yes yes immediately throw away fight like fricking barbarian mean like serious many people quote stuff like like family guy joke like quoting jesus jesus walks like work talking anyway basically like art war one things like thing sure successful attacking something undefended like yeah yeah yeah know fight defended well moments time borderline defenseless attack moment could see seize moment capable expect successful damn sure gon na successful important successful even somehow wo countered guess like trick almost like conflict right like showing person taking nap funny like take like protracted war like oh takes five years know lulls battle month couple weeks another battle like well shrink microcosm macrocosm idea thing whole war taking place five minutes minutes minutes moments lulls person effectively going snack like horror movie like hey guys gon na go get beer around way like dead sure particular instructional convert words talk finishing submission interesting insights find beautiful profound finishing rear neck choke finishing submissions back control something like know talk squeeze crush kinds principles something control process finishing find especially profound position absolutely opposite one profound truth another profound truth like jesus say actually guy tumblr yeah really really cool like tree background anyway let say like use examples like first saw someone finishing heel hook ufc one promo like chubby dude karate gi like inside heel hook another dude go huh well know back least whether many times someone something works go okay cool versus hey maybe time anyway long taught seatbelt way seatbelt jiu jitsu like long time works fact works well people used prolific went well solve one good go right thinking go imagine like merkel merkel flip positions showing dvd pretty much whatever heck digital vd vd want digital video something basically recognizing wrong side least effective mean side good could something literal borderline opposite go huh well something like imagine like would say almost things tactics strategies guess something came like training gym like year ago maybe playing since huge like oh wait let get straight first use strong side seatbelt right arm shoulder time well really helpful lot better left sides left bet life able finish would want right arm everything tactic strategy evolved idea like capitalism idea anarchy idea becomes well mean consequences fallout start idea guard right go well mean use guard northern martial art really developed guard way well guard guard defensive idea kind back extent another using legs wall person guy represents danger like yeah great idea mean clearly works least certain extent wan na put legs wan na get dude trying put things floor wan na generate ton power first thing feet anchor floor drive punch name move away jump dart name mean terrible idea back clearly works clearly little phrase function function giving much focus assigning disproportionate effectiveness maybe good idea saying good idea foundational idea much one questions foundation much innovation built top idea well course wan na back okay position innovating innovating within closed system even think innovating like open space oh god anything reality could anything within little set realize set realize box would answers would become immediately apparent willing look outside literally never even look left even realize left exists think lot places whether back control generally guards different positions lot space like lot discovered questioning basic assumptions maybe give examples like back control like something discovered merkle versus seatbelt merkle seatbelt seatbelt right arm shoulder left arm arm side choking arm merkle thing even adjust hands walk left side opposite side actually powerful position people listening people might know seatbelt control talking one person back another person really dominant position seatbelt guess widely accepted way holding arm best practices almost best practices yeah worked well one arm one arm certain side supposed back everyone teaches choking arm arm body supposed certain side relative ryan describing questioning basic assumptions side supposed let say even assumption even first principles assumption pretty close getting let say sake argument goes lot deeper maybe think innovation see innovation basically changing color car polishing window little bit like hey made little bit different made little bit better like oh man guard grabbed lapel saying bad fundamentally changing anything think big seismic shifts see almost anything come hey thing thought right wrong rather right even righter like wrong bad like oh man let say instance make triangle better let say made triangle little bit better taught mean call innovation know man like person said hey guys ever heard triangle came like feel like list thing people kidding imagine invented straight right hand like one punch man walk around lay low every single person got fight even occur hit backhand world full jabbers throw backhand gon na kill people way mean pause first somebody invent triangle probably trivial thing many giant things go like oh yeah use imagine triangles heel hooks naked chokes beat borderline mean like experience every single one particularly us mean first start training legs years well let count wrestling years ago right let say time particularly still like kind yeah like hey experienced like relative like white belt able easily beat friends yeah everyone wrestled buddies one ones like weapons end fight weapons end fight crazy asymmetric advantage lose man like get like next time like got rifle nothing decided put back run try karate chop like okay next time make sure use rifle bud like oh yeah yeah yeah kind fascinating mean everything describing fascinating tension like whenever show people first time triangle like regular people like discovering like oh okay interesting mean mma changed people watched mma interesting move make sense would choke kind quickly accepted thing accept basics without questioning wait minute actually choked shoulder person choking like sure fully questioned fundamentals like claim either exactly blood supply cut like anatomy physiology work understood else yeah else really important thing know end user almost everyone almost anything serious like think stuff life things really think like martial arts martial arts strategy like know couple things much anything else life borderline unexamined like think put lot effort something like think could figure least things figured almost nothing anything life even looked end user capable versus literally alter source code neo freaking matrix alter code ca like think ah imagine anything even forget like purple belt compared white belt compared belt might well john jones marcelo garcia gon na beat comparably bad actually common thing people ca tell difference levels like oh man trained black belt instructor much better could like much better gon na hard time wrapping head around remember first trained marcelo garcia decent purple belt course mollywopped gently training definitely better gyanogi worlds year purple belt definitely record definitely world champion wanted purple belt like winning black belt tough accomplishment thing anyway definitely better beat like okay lot better got medal adcc time trials crushed everybody like submitted everybody like bop bop bop bop training marcelo garcia worse training marcelo garcia idea would able tell difference outcome difference rounds significantly experienced adept time occurred like many number times person submit pass guard round like know probably like let say five one brief period time unless three one six another like whatever comparable six one half dozen would able easily tell difference would say know concept way better much better plenty people could beaten bad marcelo purple belt brown belt maybe would watch marcelo walk like borderline neat like back kind talking certain people beginning really like peel back really special martial arts activity presume get level understanding depth playing like almost reality thing playing rules rules even one let use matrix analogy even agent best version something playing rules yes like one regular people one regular people got matrix like oh cool fight agent lose rules play bone well agent encounters neo nothing like operating outside rules really rules perceive rules clearly anyway guess kind point marcelo certain people things go even seem real seem real understand going guess get base assumptions like constantly strip away strip away strip away let say always thought turning left right correct turns turning right correct change life yeah socrates said unexamined life worth living basically rigorously constantly examine every assumption give life meaning come back struggle come back free come back could strip away right cool right let stick needle arm yeah mean constant striving understanding yet another lower layer simulation living something actually deeply fulfilling know genetically built something striving understand seems deeply human funny makes human talk soul anymore man went catholic school kid whether buy stuff like soul person spirit people spirit nation anywhere spirit humanity talk everything like quantifiable thing maybe certain things maybe everything happens things quantifiable nothing understanding ever explain mean assumption assumption explain everything let get dang bottom peel peel peel peel actually something like need challenge yeah could looking wrong place going ah genes maybe saying looking wrong place like would know anything karate basically even well yeah karate mediocre ask raymond daniels steven thompson guess come back though yellow belt yet man actually ever see seinfeld episode kramer fights kids yeah raymond daniels school kids class addition alleyway oh finished afterwards yeah exactly last legs yeah would maybe funny feel like something deeply missing public understanding almost like idea figure everything deeply believe also possibility things never really see things never understand something like said uniquely human human experience even power change wan na fuck man wan na change thing oh yeah well would great immediately knew outcome everything press button like oh kind point living life even could seen jurassic leave sorry know talking ian malcolm jurassic park jeff goldblum right life finds way concerned whether could stop think whether maybe think mean deeply human thing also really useful thing always kind assume giant thing understand forever striving understand process gives meaning also keeps making better like thinking actually even thinking ca understand everything lead stop early like think something whether soul whether like religious stuff like assuming thing possibly understand really good assumption operate first principles kind thinking keep digging keep digging keep digging even seems like bottom fucking know bottom back back one guess kind tangents comes back everyone human smartest human history humanity hilariously weak like intelligent bro understand say saying comparison comparison everyone awesome goat thing basically cosmic level imagine vampire like years old like much would seem would seem like lowercase g god people like could know much long view perspective would insane mean seems like talking ai right creating things infinitely smarter us effectively live time probably going tell us right probably well hope keeps us around way think ai existential threats like speaking gods whole technological world talked social networks increasing power technology around us becoming less human keep becoming keep relying technology becoming kinds cyborgs also future quite possible technology becomes smarter powerful us humans know starts life ways perhaps imagine human beings mean like robots walking around humans smarter mean like intelligent life beyond fundamentally different human life infinite also creating new species yeah yeah new kind species even new species talking systems like lives space information lives different time scale different scale sorts spatial scale operate like spoke individuals operate sense single individual like embody embodied like thing walks around like looks stuff consumes world able much larger scale sensing environment around kind stuff barely even try barely even conceive would like scared excited define scared excited feel like tend define like way like guess kind like karaoke thing well actually kind happy place much everyone else know everyone else probably know heading door point know leading karaoke session well depends whether know know start like guy like halfway song already know throw beer categories song particular song talking terms like happy place oh man kidding mean obviously bohemian rhapsody mean question really oh yeah sing like remember oh yeah course yeah yeah yeah right torn torn feelings bohemian rhapsody like beginning part sadness solo heartbreak second part understand ridiculous gets ridiculous ridiculous ruins flexing people think actually hit hit know falsetto yeah okay appreciate enough musical beauty complexity song like flex people well like yeah like purpose anything except let everyone know think cool better way karaoke sure captive audience yeah exactly oh fear excitement artificial intelligence mean know know anything basically understand implications would say like radically altering means human unbelievably short period time seems like crazy thing also like ca remember said recently might ca remember definitely idea even going hey would like opt everyone everyone opted know particularly wan na talk like large scale robotics large scale ai like world changing people senegal opting right without realizing even like mean pick senegal whatever country comes mind developing world basically know recognizing huge shift coming idea decent idea also something else always considered know think really awful awful awful things done history large scale slavery name people say came motivation motivation maybe maybe fundamentally issue least mind historian power differential ca contest contend like fight might win fight even win comfortably unbelievably powerful compared nothing stop seems like recipe something really really great happening think like know european countries encountering speculating know anything history let say countries contend one another versus countries ca let say alien species alien race shows know right want think stephen hawking said makes perfect sense want come better hope nice gon na gon na hope invade water planet like know one lord worlds yeah war worlds guess trying get across like shocking levels power differential groups makes world ripe horrific abuse event someone decides like like imagine adult hitting child like hitting hitting child one right mind would ever go like oh yeah great idea grossly imbalanced like wrong also table gross imbalance guess come back like whether create ai crazy level charge seems like creating mentioned like game theory nuclear war prevented nuclear war mean presumably mutually assured destruction mean hopefully also humanity humanity reasonable know cooler heads prevailing going hey understand veil ignorance go oh yeah let kill guys ca go wrong period concept action take also nice easy keep honest know ca get without got happens get anyone anything less untouchable like seems like various times colonial history know mean happened know happened possibility really bad things plentiful possibilities possibilities really positive things plentiful like though saying wrong know give million examples one examples parent child said power differential like parent hitting child hitting like beating beating yeah great beating child often see happening even though power differential first people kids let put table love kids people kids annoying sometimes sometimes got ta deal justice get practice take advantage power differential like ethics moralities emerge allow power differential used good versus bad like one assumptions stephen hawking russia became much powerful america america much powerful russia cold war assumption immediately power differential assumption would express right would express way trying express level competition also possible power differential grows incentive joy whatever mechanisms made sense level incentives become different fun destroy ant colony start becoming kind conservationalist one hopes evolved perspective though yeah well know evolved definitely possibility unclear something many orders magnitude powerful us want destroy us well mean mass slavery occur like big dogs playing think slavery lot atrocities history happened power differential great talking ai potentially somehow worse obvious obvious things way powerful fair okay think guess restrain though lot different discussions guess even restrain let say go decide strike someone child like think would promptly find front judge feel like lot imagine many people used get murdered woods mean would presume lot think people lunatics like would point given though given ability get away greater past chance detection less allow unreasonable called artificial intelligence ai safety research called value alignment ensuring build systems become smarter smarter powerful powerful make sure values aligned entities becoming powerful humans talk ai becoming smarter first dumber becoming smarter smarter create mechanisms value things guess one thing wonder guess probably sharp enough grasp honest guess wonder use chess programs know deep blue stockfish like alpha zero alpha zero teaching beat stockfish without help four hours like becomes orders magnitude intelligence us effectively instantaneous period guess always wondered like much smarter feel like ability manipulate would pretty significant least potentially manipulation implies incentive overpower everything around like implied incentives value actually like depends want life want system clear goal ai system powerful destroy humans think either guess even enslave humans fair guess trying suggest something adequately powerful actions table yes table scary lot people really concerned working trying make case agi watching one kill actually thinking yeah wash toilets like really well mean main concern people ai safety research people talk agi kind disturbing little people working trying create mechanisms keep ai values aligned completely unshocking yeah humans seem good like even look like coronavirus like water leaking ceiling blood everywhere fire destruction seem ignore completely trouble writing wall writing wall fine sure nothing see okay right especially united states figure even becomes really serious problem taking actions last minute something innovative spirit results solution last minute right deadline works well mean know school probably lot better exactly school could motivation like last like hours entire semesters work like let yeah like fricking mountain dews yeah well failures life talked mentioned cal newport book deep work variety creatures basically everything ahead time shocking dislikes thinks unproductive experience stress anxiety deadline going best going best work make completely irrational function based deadline system process gets stuff little bit stuff done every day like constantly systematically honest say going get stuff done today week end day end week reflect planned improve plan update constantly update every day every week every quarter whatever durations listening reading stuff like oh yeah agree everything like yes clapping like reality go back eat cheetos like shit like last minute ai easy cheesy yeah actually eat cheetos yes actually ever matter ever going matter shockingly productive well thought whatever decided think trying monkey wrench definitely going able deal funny human god strengths corresponding weakness less practice working gun less comfortable working gun practice working gun better get downside always working gun less productive like work quality maybe drops interesting thing like almost like hey wonder wonder khabib nurmagomedov lot heart say answer almost certainly yes go well struggled bunch maybe struggle well happens also work gun really well like yeah interesting thing like guess aristotle repeatedly practicing something time guess funny guess question though would love ask really neat certain jobs mean obviously wan na preparation always always certain things like degree like entropy system go need practice working gun saying need fighting part really sterile environment grand scheme things like fighting cage sterile compared things life right dangerous sterile unless course like guy ref decides hit hilarious anyway guess going like okay value get adding degree let say could even planned someone else junk system work gun make happen let say instance like police something like situation turns left hard random point time could happen number people guess interesting things allow perfect planning quasi perfect planning versus things inherently unstable psychological fallout comfort think lot people really comfortable gun let happen lot good bad make sense totally makes sense mean answer would honest valuable success practice gun schedule yeah smart plan systematically opposed opposed letting environment choose randomness control randomness optimize efficient shocking hear yeah mean way annoying way like drops truth bombs like yeah yeah true yeah probably comparably profession requires like motivational speaker whatever computer scientist theoretical computer scientist needs long hours day like serious math mostly math proofs sit think really deeply like really hard work compared like people like even mean like programming way easier rigorous math proofs basically machine brain churn logic focused way visualizing bunch things holding brain holding minutes minutes hopefully several hours like homework totally novel stuff like stuff nobody ever done keep running wall like fuck dead end oh wait dead end like whole frustration serious mental work like incredibly difficult mental work knows talking amazing like said like seems like standard quality work needs high high almost anything less level systematization organization would preclude right ca afford kind bullshit know certainly like last deadline kind stuff ca kind work last minute deadline kind stuff question general like like well negative patterns like shit last minute think really big free thinking mostly predestination predestination least regard like communism like long fits whatever lazy thing believe free yeah communist opportunist opportunistic communist capitalist whatever whatever cool time exactly let ask examine fundamental principles particular thing joe rogan brought several times online offline thinks tie wear something makes vulnerable attack reason wear tie get choked easily tie big concern okay contention way wore suit last time wear podcast wore dinner later yeah wore suit day socks realize yeah supposed wear socks yeah understanding wear suit go court one know wanted play wanted pretend adult day okay cool contention jacket everything dangerous tie kind going kind first thought tie becomes issue yeah feel like everything else already issue already issue yeah tie without messing similar problems belt example know maybe correct sure use belt tied know kind guards probably utilize belt belt sorry tied around waist talking belt belt gi belt sorry gi belt okay sorry gi belt importantly gi belt great thing use cases would say slides yep true probably invent interesting ways use leverage control many things around better better better tie people realize better trying sell dvd widgets bells whistles case belt really important part would really encourage guys look trying actually learn something say like said surrounded better options well thing mean obvious belt maybe actually undiscovered things using belt think people used like putting foot inside belt somehow inside gi belt well punches gi grappling situation yes okay yeah guess already fairly contrived right punches like okay let talk street fight belt like jeans belt like belt clothing belt okay get take whip face buckle serious street fight talking like far serious talking like death like one die oh yikes whoa okay oh ever situation time understand okay reason still something something fight starbucks day fight kids talking power differential yeah hey beat kids time hey pick easy ws got ta get easy ws wo hard ones undefeated come around playground watch happens like death clothing useful know mean like use use use use like like want take belt use buckle hit first gon na take belt well lot effort involved unclothing well figuring started see take pants fight like gon na pause rethink situation second yes started get eye contact obviously going yeah exactly nodding know time realized took belt could whip actually already one possibly two steps ahead okay fine let talk clothing let talk clothing okay take belt hit much harder question oh maintaining eye contact like come point alternatives perhaps effective yeah like perspective might clueless almost clothing effective almost assuming situation geek grappling like feel like particularly start add hitting like every single time start grabbing clothes start hitting like nothing could work time like using arms something better right right yeah difficult know terms distance ca imagine case different distances even like situations let talk like like situation yet agreed fight happening solid clothing nice solid clothing oh yeah like something like good jacket snatch somebody face snatch snatch yeah know like took like know like snap judo like easy snap beginner yeah agree actually tie sense might really effective way snap like snap really powerful change like disorient situation give lot different opportunities know taking back taking hilarious stuff like snapping tie knee come back yeah sense agree choking mechanism concern joe choke think probably choke tie easily could choke tie probably like get get like get back put around somebody neck know like like like ever see diehard yeah yeah remember super swedish looking blonde dude whatever trying choke bruce willis chain yeah ended getting choked chain recall properly anyway yeah like like yeah feel like feel like start grabbing tie many great options mean like snap actually made realize think yeah good think right path snap yeah particularly start like one like know like like like poke finger chest snap real quick oh yeah also socially speaking threatening thing know reach tie particularly like business setting know mean oh never see coming yeah thinking choke really good leverage point cause like grabbing jacket jacket slide try snap really get hole like really good hole good point cause around back neck clip much jackass would look like feel like stick ever see japanese politician think japan judo throw yeah guy calm cool like every beautiful technique level actually throw even gentle yeah perfect amazing well executed yeah politicians toss shit yeah need teddy roosevelt exactly like politicians like talking fighting clear none even would ever fight ever yeah somebody saying teddy roosevelt interesting realize one greatest presidents country one greatest presidents even though faced crisis whatsoever literally willed like nothing happened presidency bad motherfucker made really great speeches like know uh made realize talking story like people think great need also good crisis reveal greatness muhammad ali right muhammad ali mean sports know mean like circumstances greatness know mean like capacity face right quality opposition circumstance overcome guess saying joe rogan wrong tie thing know want go far saying wrong know man defend maybe things understanding willing deeply thought main criticism joe deeply thought mma journalists like uh ryan hall says joe rogan wrong hates ties hates ties integrate hitler back somehow nice nice uh talking greatness greatness requiring difficult moment time like reflect back think hardest hardest thing ever life well know think bunch things know lot things go way know incredibly fortunate lot things go way also uh leaving leaving team lord urban firmly believe right thing um one uh uh difficult time like difficult choice uh leaving um psychologically first loss general leaving yeah team family kinds matter circumstances lose friends lost lot people thought friends uh lost training lost also like really serious wrist like uh really serious uh wrist surgery like know going able compete anymore got brown belt tough time like uh psychologically physically everything motivated best push uh carry positive direction matter different direction uh lonely thing family even abusive family leaving tough people complicated even people think well think whole think well unfair paint one brush um know obviously greater lesser examples like person discussed last time infinitely know beyond almost anyone could ever imagine meeting personal lives yeah bloody elbow terms forgiveness hate mean hate heart people past process mean definitely times negatively motivated prove people wrong accomplish things despite think valuable line felt differently think particularly really well conflict useless usual deadline thing useless yeah useless like chaos useless useless antagonist like fighting like competition like pushed like feeling like play well going get hurt choice play well play everything got least guess would say though know gotten know time know lived little bit longer see know various situations know increased color guess would say increased clarity know lot lessons learned even times history bad experiences question take lessons move forward think seeing sometimes socially right forgetting important lessons past good saying hey get could going direction understand entirely hey let forget lessons learn really serve anybody anyway guess would say thankful experiences difficult otherwise mostly difficult honestly times remember thankful every loss ever particularly tough ones thankful know relationships many people taught many things continue teach many things still closest friends people really get along people think really poorly others many last group guess would say lot things opportunities learn know throughout also never done made mistakes magnitude differences like think definitely say none mistakes ever made mistakes intention know screwed lot things life confidently easily say never ill intent towards people done sit like man right thing right thing sometimes wrong know never sit malicious intent think find think people things differently think malicious intent difficult time forgiving love win hate ryan hall world talk social media talk forgiveness complicated people past scale entire world ai destroys us human race lost history think love wins hate well like preface saying tried make pancakes day yes work happy comment basically wow think times think struggled know times read unable see humanity people also even sometimes enemies people done awful things go would allow people forgive done depending upon know things forgivable things less want understand like knowledge demons populate world neither like literal angels walking around actually perfect lot times things find deeply amusing watching know people hoisted batard twitter even though gross really unproductive actually like equal parts amusing like awful happy someone raked coals particularly unjustifiably funny exact thing raking others coals like week two prior happened repeatedly continue happen guess would say mentioned know prior know like recognition humanity others us make mistakes difficult understand intention arguments close friends mine text message us ended super pissed completely misreading tone intention person even reading correctly easy ascribe negative possible know least charitable assessment think dangerous way live life also fruitless way live life know one

orchestra kind cool yeah metallica always one greatest yeah awesome bad example yet awesome band let say like nickelback something like feel feels cheap everyone makes fun nickelback yeah know guess depends want define warrior something think comes trying evaluate various people situations things read heard circumstances involved think lot times easy look outcomes obviously outcome live world outcomes matter time like look let say cuba able pull combat sports perspective staggering like amount successful olympic level competitors wrestling boxing judo mean tiny little island money people shocking think olympics united states well course well mean russia well china well india better honestly obviously means like much least certain sports resources talent gon na issue something like starting point like argument like people say maradona know soccer oh yeah big soccer okay say maradona better messi basically carried team world cup team would otherwise win world cup messi successful barcelona like superstars playing superstars right yeah fair say mean like united lot factors go let say winning soccer game obviously barcelona particularly various points time ridiculous squad players say instance maybe creative players argentina needed get ball messi know like nes know know backing midfield obviously argentina always ridiculous attacking players like even alongside messi like three killers front little less behind interesting say depends define warrior probably take like civil rights leaders go direction like leaders general look like greatest martial artists history direction somebody mind would say least three three pop head would hannibal alexander great maybe miyamoto musashi know two commanders one know guy interesting mentioned warriors able make lot little know musashi famous winning duels know oftentimes one know alexander hannibal know military commanders one faced rome interesting thing oftentimes know coming novel tactics different strategies sometimes resourced novel crazy things skin game interesting thing think lot times know playing video game think warrior skin game get hurt lose bummer stings little bit maybe makes feel slightly disappointed know musashi loses loses hannibal loses loses alexander loses loses lose guess people around lose almost like could use even combat sports perspective muhammad ali mean consider also quality opposition musashi fighting high quality opposition obviously hannibal alexander particularly hannibal fighting unbelievable opposition muhammad ali fought phenomenal opposition skin game ring actually meshes mentioned like civil rights type situation pushing stone uphill neat thing think muhammad ali much personal conviction man order pull able pull outside ring reminds great leaders great fighters throughout history make kind difficult idea conquerors like alexander great somebody listen hardcore history dan carlin apparently elon musk also big fan genghis khan episode large percent world call genghis khan ancestor difficult truth conquerors lot murder rape pillage stealing resources kind stuff yet often remembered quite honorable mean case genghis khan lot people argue look historically way described full context ultimately like given time liberator progressive say know like terms violence atrocities committed least stories always provided option resist basically option wan na join us want die die horribly progressive sort bernie sanders era nice make much great conquerors much murder us would seem insane funny mentioned think maybe human nature thing want maybe misunderstanding thing want cast characters maybe entirely good entirely negative guess phrase saying one man freedom fighter another person terrorist accurate lot times think understand long able look various people perspective like look tv show wire obviously know widely everybody loves wire thought everyone saying anything said compelling characters angles whether like character dislike character able understand motivations people various things even wrongly rightly know want cast demons throughout history completely inhuman think makes difficult us understand want look back people think great entirely great think experiencing problems know even right socially politically trying look back decide people thought good good people thought bad good rather going hey good bad things mentioned genghis khan thing fight back respect gon na conflict see happens lose gon na sorry make way want continue utilizing kind mo need discourage next guy right ultimately though guess interesting thing imagine put every single person planet earth cage crime drops know also certain positives things difficult ultimately law jungle think able supersede modern times think fortunate mentioned look back say oh horrible say life base level lion gazelle really like much call lion bad guy sanctify gazelle way around interesting pull back controls put behavior modern life think generally speaking positive get things often time modern life built people like genghis khan get ends justifying means tough question things easy answers least certainly smarts figure answers difficult would say people world complicated layered depending upon side line standing various times may like dislike someone ca remember whose idea killing veil ignorance guess philosophical idea veil ignorance go sticking everyone cage right thing say everyone say well well would make life easier went took stuff long could stop mean course great idea everyone every video game skyrim steal stuff people around ultimately go well right thing side would appreciate inherently good thing think gon na win fine way white hat guess would say think without philosophical underpinnings rein us guess morally speaking difficult say right wrong say certain actions reaction almost like physics sense kill everyone way long able life easier mean setting table someone longer tough guy yeah look instagram channel nature metal hurts heart watch remind comfortable descendant ape vicious nature unapologetically mean process bad guy always wins violence solution problems flip side running away violence solution depending skillset funny think us humans extra little piece brain somehow trying figure like said philosophical way supersede move past viciousness cruelty cold exchange nature perhaps maybe nature maybe way life maybe trying hard egotistical thinking somehow separate nature somehow distant thing could agree fact think actually orson scott card writer great book called ender game statement main character ender made book brother brilliant brother like kind sociopathic brilliant kid ended kicked school battle commander dealing brother taught ultimately strength courage ability violence good bad one fundamental important things able life ca cause destruction ca cause pain forever subject think mentioned egotism think disease could obviously strike us something looking think unbelievably thankful people live world walk street without worry like well worry six foot six pound person gon na leave alone rolex whatever fine person deciding leave alone agreed live relatively sane constrained society benefits us philosophical underpinning nature dictates way nature dictates go different direction person thing stopping person something either person someone else stand us ca one stand us thing stopping person person hope either disinterested disinclined sort thing think know keeping mind fundamental nature world whether like important think quest fundamentally alter human nature gon na ultimately fruitless also little bit egotistical lion lion know try box try know guide direction direction know nature always unless wan na start constrain significantly starting get individual rights put charge says one make choice constraining many awful things happened throughout history one group one person decided constrain others like genghis khan well little level gon na benefits beneficiaries absolutely losers guess dangerous game almost like putting one ring remember frodo offered one ring gandalf gandalf said would take away would put would use desire good would wield power terrible ca imagine think big question anyone decides able reach able power mean obviously ca speak imagine national level global level power would use would try change world would glad line know yeah mean thing struggling society maybe nice get quick comment people traditionally powerless seeking fairer society equal society attaining power justly also realization least perspective power corrupts everyone even flag wave justice right overuse term nice thoughts whole idea cancel culture internet twitter nuanced difficult discussions race gender fairness equality justice kinds things shouting oftentimes nuanced discussion kind trying reason difficult issues history future looks like thoughts internet discourse going something positive pull interesting thing see guess mentioned internet tool us use interesting thing see guess mentioned anytime wielding power whomever carefully important easy look people power using poorly used poorly go hey bad guy go well course power use properly may intend use properly maybe time people people people think lot think believe human beings one matter whether got two arms two legs heart brain live similar experience obviously variations theme less human person never met china person virginia people guess ultimately believe human beings corruptible power corrupts fallible say things either intentionally unintentionally wish think allow space guess word almost religious term guess would say grace something see disappearing discourse public maybe sure interesting watching occur internet also longer talk sitting bus stop writing everything writing old saying like put writing put anything writing get trouble basically degree everything recorded recorded tiny little bites easy wave every last little foolish ignorant incorrect correct thing someone ever said done face support whatever argument trying make situation think mentioned cancel culture seems exist obviously poisonous face poisonous sort thing incentivize proper behavior mean look let say one great monsters history adolf hitler obviously done awful awful things also anyone even minor student history positive things well embroider person crimes act nothing good monster ever done nothing bad great person throughout history ever done imagine ghost adolf hitler pop go oh gosh guys sorry know done like apologize start make right well mean hope popped go well really like done like time glad hear attempting make right push positive direction even ca make right otherwise disincentivizing change better looking wield whatever power punitive fashion encourage people anything double wrongs made knowing least gon na support people support guess want would hopefully look use internet tool educate guess like word empower empower people various things extend reach educate learn rather solidify little tribal things exist think everyone humanity human history vulnerable mean look course human history deeply tribal tribes groups top various points time done lot times bad things ones hope could learn lessons past rather committing crimes committed us recommitting slide top position say could understand urge seek vengeance strong anyone says differently would trust time enough experience history enough experience life enough hopefully wisdom time go right answer gon na replay things worst parts history best want encourage positive behavior lash people although understandably done understandably simply gon na perpetuate cycle gone point hope even though seeing lot turmoil societally moment globally moment guess better angels prevail certain point gon na take great deal leadership think sorely missing like martin luther king style character moment great leader hoping one show sure way word hear often think beautiful one grace really interesting word gon na think religious component exactly right somehow walk line mentioned hitler reading rise fall third reich really thinking like economic concern economic pain people feeling quietly really suffering heard echoes great depression hunger charismatic leader like said leader could walk grace could inspire could bring people together sort dreams better future positive hitler exactly everything said except word positive give dream german people great people great people better future certain point quickly turned better future requires literally expansion land started well wan na build great germany need little bit land need kind get austria need kind get france mostly france understand land really useful need get rid look us versailles anyway jewish holocaust separate thing know well know know think jewish lot echoes suffering family people lost know hitler wrote mein kampf know evil committed along mean question forgiveness mean hitler difficult person talk question cancel culture deserving forgiveness like holocaust survivors read heard interviews often spoken fact way let go overcome atrocities experienced forgive like forgiveness way interesting think know even society ready even contemplate idea forgiveness hitler interesting idea though good thought exercise least think people canceled bad things different degrees think like louis somebody like good person path forgiveness also good person good person sliding scale could find looking uncomfortable end gun particularly line mean hope best definitions guess like said important canceling canceled necessarily said saying entirely unjustified certainly understandable particularly mentioned like monster like adolf hitler also interesting could help notice like mentioned society us able apply forgiveness someone done much horror people personal mean course many many people personally affected directly personally affected someone survivor holocaust able let go nowhere near big enough person sort thing guess interesting thing person physically potentially able let go know unbelievably powerful interesting guess wonder sometimes obviously regards holocaust holding various things facilitative guess something else really enjoy ultimate fighter let music books religious tech brought bible brought quran started read side side really interesting reading bible little drier quran interestingly written think something consistently brought way merciful people want think us want justice think want justice think want justice justice dangerous dangerous dangerous game maybe person wronged deeply want justice wan na balance justice balancing scales sometimes understand societal level think fine mean crime punishment go benefits drawbacks think us want mercy within reason grace mentioned justice dangerous thing valuable important thing gets decide justice actually meted maybe get meet justice get comeuppance well sounds great happens pointed back guess comes back veil ignorance idea one day live world envisioned world created think lot times people love idea judge crimes lawyer heard day thought great think dangerous thing hopefully gives us pause rightly wrongly always understandably know wielding serious power yeah justice kind drug look history also reading lot stalin mean folks really know inside hitler head actually tricky one think legitimately insane stalin stalin like literally thought good thing literally thought entirety time communism going bring like utopia going create happy world mind ideas justice fairness happiness yeah human flourishing drug somehow sadly pollutes mind start thinking like good society believing good sense good society intoxicating especially others around feeling way start like building movement forget like like barely recently evolved ape like know hell start like killing witches whatever like start start math let honest though mean sometimes got witch go witch yeah agree witch witch go floats sinks one forget one whichever one need time honestly floating sunk yeah yeah yeah definitely agree witches go brought tweeted recently also one things really ashamed life really read almost classics really yeah like whole journey reading like literary philosophers would say like camus hesse dostoevsky kafka like place like kind world creates world deepest questions human nature explored realize world puts like removes kind historical context explore ideas like space somewhere elsewhere different time different place allows almost like freedom like construct artificial things crazy crazy kind human experiments working books list foundation series isaac asimov dune snow crash neil stevenson ender game like mentioned kind posted course like elon musk john carmack know know creator doom quake stuff see pitched nerds ultra nerds started like going like need read like started working okay seems like list mentioned holds somewhat book books series authors find amazing maybe another way ask like greatest book time well like start sharing something embarrassed read anything orson scott card jr tolkien frank herbert tolkien yeah dune yeah aware wikipedia surface reading things like book called republic written good ones read wikipedia prolific reader wikipedia articles well occasional occasionally exactly whatever else waste time yeah also say posted reddit questions ryan hall like million questions like half dune really like people bring dune understand mention dune well actually showy role actually made us gi one time thought kind cool send one give one got extra awesome actually point actually orson scott card quote actually writer ender game fiction somebody actually lived real world always possibility oneself think neat thing heard people respect sharp people actually every dig heels go like fiction like nonfiction instructive would go completely disagree think hard enough time figuring happened three hours ago let tell happened years bc like hey interested tell story factual components doubt struggle sometimes guess like fiction tell story people mean every less believable things think dune would unbelievably opinion know really like dune say example human beings interacting one another political component emotional intellectual relationship components think dune neat novel loosest sense really story religion group dynamics human potential belief learning politics governance ecology best stories remind history way history hopefully list facts try able recall factoids try recall story understand see threads time kind came together created certain things lot times like say like ah heck going right years years past happened look back far enough accurate knowledge hypothetical perfect pool shot beginning time would see unbroken chain events led us potentially lead us going hindsight helpful think neat like guess really enjoy instance book like dune actually making movie skeptical honest gon na difficult bring screen variety reasons one yeah least questions ask ryan thinks new dune movie enough authority sort decent opinion guess would say much goes character mind like much day lived experience internal majority many times people walking around know like hey see right like oh well see picture see wall hey lex really paying attention going inside head moment almost rest world tuned kind dimmed guess think gon na struggle time wan na bring type written story visual medium think gon na difficult interesting definitely one favorite stories honestly helped become better life opinion better martial arts think writer think frank herbert absolutely brilliant whether ideas reality none us good ideas combination maybe came something curator good ideas things borrowed somewhere without even realizing think way messages themes ideas conveyed particularly original novel absolutely brilliant one greats flip side another way ask somebody new something would recommend entry point enough world read lot isaac asimov anything like recommend dune obnoxious evangelist dune anyone listen would strongly recommend thing mentioned probably talking much important things thing mentioned skyrim play video games favorite game would say greatest video game time huge fan elder scrolls oh cool yeah mean play little bit point little less finally moved new house like adult like yeah entirely

republic star wars game huge star wars fan became less recently disney like watched yet mandalorian oh actually like mandalorian actually pretty cool yeah like waving canceled yeah could cancel one thing would cancel disney star wars gon na edit part okay let go next people wanting watching youtube dislike amount like comment good job good job making internet hate regret nothing baby yoda yeah guess like little got ears uses force sometimes passes qualms baby yoda yeah heart okay let go okay audience podcast may know much really part culture really know much see many people fallen love transformed know much like thing way could sort try explain essence martial art captured minds hearts many people world think philosophy expressed physically kind development mental capacity physical capacity working unison move efficiently almost flowingly unresistingly given situation physically resisting opponent learning generate force steal force floor steal force person move concert opposed clash watch two untrained people fight almost entirely clash runaway clash runaway clash watch done well looks like water moving around solid structure think expressed physically think things anyone really able well end kind exemplifying think true martial arts general think lot times like clashing see going working well fact get physically powerful people every able get away think fantastic ultimately results driven thing think essence martial arts learning make less move yielding almost like real life aikido think martial arts like water flowing aikido moving around force opposed sort maybe wrestling mindset finding leverage apply exceptional amount force like maximizing application force guess maybe better way like marry two ideas think flow point greater force point time apply look best wrestlers say best necessarily mean successful although course successful always good throughout course history boxing wrestling judo magical disappear reappear like fighting ghost like incorporeal want find want find finds think see buwaisar side tubes wrestling guess could look floyd mayweather willie pepp purnell whitaker boxing brilliant examples disappearing reappearing strong almost like guerrilla warfare strong nowhere found weak ca get rid think looking yeah brothers incredible look like skinny starbucks baristas manhandle everybody effortlessly effortlessly look like

wrestler think gold medal yeah yeah cindy year took silver show inside trip effortless oh gee yep know really creative kind wrestling organic yeah throw kinds things mix judo mix weird kind moves funky ben askren legitimate basic well funky funky sake poking ben askren imply funny lot times almost like musashi talked lot goal combat win outcome outcome driven versus flourishing cool looking movements like unless utilitarian purpose wasting time fight also practice mentioned almost like looks like judo looks like wrestling looks like almost like guess reminds martial arts deeply tribal well wan na learn lex fridman martial arts wan na learn another guess transcendent person martial arts happened set movements tended time thanks body type opposition whatnot try codify force work opposed going wan na understand body works concert congress something else forces move appropriately like always struck scythe brothers great examples moving like water use bruce lee little tripe brilliant like water flow water crash would crash needed crash would flow needed flow would flow purpose dissipating crash would win right moment go back flowing second person found beautiful watch artistic think great expression anything physical ultimately studied science expressed art think something gets lost lot times gets little bit little nerdy like hand hand like like details better reality experience done might fun exercise saying like main positions submissions art complete ridiculously apologize putting spot like might nice exercise think sure mean would say arms bend various ways key lock americana straight arm locks kimura omoplata omoplata kimura kimura omoplata executed submissions like breaking arm kinds ways ultimately question let say terminator like robot course go go like right completely literal could harm things would still use positions answer yes create leverage create control create shapes affect affect affected forces objects structures like ground wall enjoy mixed martial arts another component rather floor floor wall another player game exist grappling context within guess area combat strangle choke call without arms involved use one shoulders pin one side one carotid artery enclose turn knee exact ways turn arm straight way way add rotation directly linear joint guess would say able understand given look learn language rather learning five bazillion adjectives go understand adjective course read degree vocabulary understand adverb understand adverb know noun know component parts sentence know guess clause contraction things allows interesting artistic language extent ca like speak degree spanish even slightly artistic spanish would something speak like child head injury anyway basic understanding english language allows student spanish limited experience limited understanding techniques limited understanding almost like let say techniques like vocabulary even kind sort grasp sentence structure thought process thought

way able eventually become artist studied science first start technique collection vocabulary collection way learn school remember say quickly different ways let say speak spanish know three might use quickly might use adjective like quickly spanish use one many many options describe understand sit go like wait ca artistic ca organic language like believe lot times starts acquisition lot hey drill technique americana americana armlock armlock triangle problem oftentimes get stuck phase people eventually become move collectors sequence collectors noticed trying dvds guess like instructional series even teaching class believe form learning anymore valuable believe understand level anymore trying get across basic ideas people say hey need fill gaps going class time need go hey learn move learn technique learn technique otherwise basically throwing like different words could use really taught speak language whereas give language structure fill pieces eventually speak organically lex form ultimately unique otherwise end like weird facsimile whatever mostly worst say yeah people mean people comment like especially people listened guy drunk high mit really allow slow people quotas quotas yeah like wrong getting sleep okay need help similar like guy guy really whatever rank throughout remember like guy really rank kind certain way sitting slow lazy looking ultimately language discover yeah liberating moment think probably years getting ass kicked especially open guard butterfly really allow take entirety language realize unique unique like language set techniques way move body needs one discover like learn specific techniques really understand body beautiful thing like said like connection philosophy view world physical like connecting two things perceive world interpret ideas world exhaustion force effortlessness like really means relax kinds loose concepts actually teach body like things like know able apply force spurts able relax spurts like figure stuff individual body mentioned could agree discovery process one cheat process time almost like imagine wan na start writing books second grade unless maybe like staggeringly brilliant like conceptualize someone able maybe mozart english language us enough knowledge enough information enough experience able express basically input repeat important process say going getting ass kicked like well work well work felt right know nobody else guess believe versus eventually going know try going way see happens get yelled people wo like works say got lucky work say dumb maybe right basically know going iterative process allows eventually find find voice fight way speak way write way think way uniquely also ultimately allow understand people uniquely even conceptualize think lot society stuff go well feel objectively right maybe couple things small box careful think objective versus open possibility things think objectively correct may may allow degree compassion consideration people martial arts journey journey know people human beings understand path iterative process eventual think one things see trouble see tribalism mean racism expression political affiliation expression things go really uncomfortable directions people looking hey plant feet thing know right agree following think see martial arts like oh style style style like hey man pushing forward certain direction trying best understand feel way may felt like one point know trying learn understand versus already acquired enough knowledge let cross arms start look fucking around think interesting trap think human trap fall definitely happens early joke world right like oh blue belt knows everything well initially like know nothing least think know nothing learn little bit think lot bit learn go like even know yeah exactly right kinda talked little bit lot people listen never mat never tried really curious everybody positions like think elon musk kids andrew yang like know world curious nice seems nice methodology humble ego grow intellectually physically people curious natural question curious would recommend get started maybe like recommend first day week month year first couple years look like like ease make sure positive experience progress optimal positive way first thing simply ask wan na involved know remember first day walked ronan athletics new york city train godfather son christian montes know getting played baseball high school manhattan college bronx wanted go learn martial arts always something interesting never something knew accessible definitely really around northern virginia grew whereas stick manhattan stuff everywhere anyway guess know expect know gon na get beat people gon na nice people gon na nice began think expectation management think something would first thing would start almost imagining getting love martial arts martial arts given everything life thankful would sitting without experience journey people met places gone could never ever ever imagined unbelievably thankful think thing helped starting going mom said something one time said two types people various situations understandable questions concerns things like maybe sometimes little bit easier younger trust people say know know go hey wan na climb rock like yeah let go hey wan na jump river yeah sure versus reason way everything talked everything lot times talk think lot times thinker disease wan na figure gon na happen expect happen get involved versus going using old bruce lee saying like amount thinking training side river teach swim jump risks associated guess psychological usually biggest ones biggest hurdle physical biggest thing guess would suggest anyone say well wan na like well wan na challenge wan na learn would like learn fight want learn fight could protect anything else people within arms reach perceive small degree power generally would use like yeah give try try reasonable hopefully make mistake apologize people basically said yeah like know gon na challenging see happens means getting beat get like hurt getting roughed getting arm bent way way getting choked like well supposed happen big deal would like going joining army peacetime going oh college education like okay cool man sudden war breaks wan na send somewhere like whoa whoa whoa whoa sign gig actually whether realize may thought getting mind right going expectations activity looking course going gym going place know people probably know people know coach even wan na hey shake hand type level students know really try polite annoy much know know understand trust would trust trust either time someone take leap one things noticed martial arts instructor biggest struggle dealing adults lot people like teach kids kids ask argue also means sorts pitfalls sort thing issue guess lot times people get point life early manager know one talks like versus like hey man go join bootcamp care elon musk gon na tell shut pushups great taking leap faith world gon na tiny fish got ta hope people guiding journey gon na ca say even say best interests heart even know try harm try help way would understand guess instance would try anyone comes gym would try help way understand need best safe reasonable way possible sometimes way gon na make uncomfortable particularly physical combat something done lot people go without even played contact sports big jump understand starting worries gon na kind work way gon na uncomfortable okay part process gon na bumps bruises gon na wan na roll guy corner person rough beat like okay big hurt little hurt big hurt okay little hurt shh need soldier little bit yeah interesting balance find think one important things anything think life selection people put around mean true like getting married true like go people ask like graduate students like phd advisor difference everything like spend five years somebody going basically define impact anybody marry anybody hang huge impact coach selection like school selection going really important terms like select define happy like trajectory growth happy entirety experience yet like flip side especially ego especially manager needs let go stuff going feel like shit best kind coach need weird balance find like mean like everybody needs different thing like much enjoy sort like sounds weird like know wrestling background enjoy feeling like crap sense like coach like getting beat actually enjoy like masochistic thing whatever know mean growth like like anxiety like feeling like shit go home like emotionally physically like growth sign growth right like feel things probably comfort zone fine growth zone right everybody different threshold mean beautiful thing like also like yoga feel like learning body depending gym depending fact coaches people around within gym select little groups kind like people roll like smaller person mean go big people go people like smoke lot weed chill go like crazy ripped blue belt competitor like destroy everybody depending like mindset kind select fascinating journey like basically could agree need may change time right maybe needed need today could change six months year something experienced use first coach christian great example someone really look respect someone helped lot like time really needed guidance needed learn martial arts get hensel gracie gym right street christian teaching christian blue belt time teaching place called fight house awesome like early warehouse area fashion avenue manhattan like seventh eighth like two basketball courts wide like samba guys kali guys wing chun jiu jitsu corner hensel one famous academies world time still know hensel gracie mean great gym fantastic place people train think right time stumbled like two person elevator found place six people trained time someone could give like addition martial arts advice like personal guidance made big difference initially would like competitions like intra gym competitions samba guys would roll like great cause bunch like russian dudes like brighton beach would come would fight everyone would train drink tea go home anyway oh russians super tough like tough group people great remember decided like four five months like man really wan na try take seriously told christian like well hey think need following know like hey guy named jeff ruth purple belt time much bigger deal always mma fighter lot amateur box spirit super tough dude jeff best person time ever trained got squashed christian used beat like jeff would absolutely kick crap like awesome back home went home summer chris like hey think stay told thinking coach know initially exactly needed like well hey maybe gon na able help onto path kind commensurate goals moment know interesting thing really got feel fortunate start place coach able transition roles comfortably think also probably factor fact know done training prior like issues coach like supporting support know feeling like hey like gon na hold onto students gon na hold onto best guy best girl even ca take need go interesting thing recognizing also though people like way individual going gym know getting coach person know may activity longer weird little know god know anything may say something pisses may may yell may help may inadvertently cause sort know sort issue able recognize even though say people said people gym like know service industry man service like get twisted like absolutely best help people best martial arts coach best martial arts coach best periodically make mistakes owe apology two try give mcdonald oh gave hundred bucks whatever want house gym dojo martial arts basketball team yeah something beautiful martial arts like exactly said coach like wrestling least collegiate like high level wrestling like dictatorship aspect coach important like ridiculous sometimes nature like master bowing traditions something seems ridiculous outside perhaps something really powerful process said letting go leap faith requires believe coach best interest mind give ideas grow interesting thing mean never able really see coaches human always always like father figure like always put position power think think least useful way see coach allows think let go really allow grow emotionally deal beatings push past oftentimes would stopped right great hopefully know paying attention still person make mistakes push would gone far facilitative right something say like faraz zahabi head coach tristar head coach mma kenny florian one head coaches mma phenomenal influences paul schreiner one assistants marcelo garcia academy coached long time brilliant instructor able think interesting guys sharp intuitive well think faraz actually know told something john wooden said john wooden legendary ucla basketball coach simple philosophical idea said people life bowl shit needs whipped cream people life bowl whipped cream needs little bit shit balance interesting thing coaching everyone way work know think difference coach instructor lot times people think wan na coach really want instructor like hey lex tell times people think want know instructor really wan na coach like man guy giving information coach much instructor huge leap something think people need understand going martial arts understand totally grasp would know think lot like giving month nothing sure pays instructor really coach relationship gets developed imagine like amount emotional investment time thinking away like oh alex anymore help need like serious difference oftentimes difference getting hump various situations interesting know bargain made like commitment instructor becomes coach commitment student know like financial transaction lot things going feel fortunate instructors time coaches means sometimes butted heads sometimes look back think right times look back definitely right always trust exception one time feel trust greatly betrayed rightly wrongly whether mistakes mistakes made everyone attempting right thing circumstances would intentionally anything malicious know versus hey might done might burnt house darn sure purpose think long mutual understanding mutual belief goodwill magic nowhere understand think great things happen look athletes know know guys girls watched become fantastic various places almost invariably never happened alone yeah know really torn like maybe help seen movie whiplash would say outsider perspective people watch guess jazz band movie drummer instructor basically would say outsider perspective toxic relationship really coach whatever call pushes musician drummer limits like feels like shit emotionally looks like toxic relationship one ultimately productive improvement musician like experience got chance train couple places regularly one coaches great human lot people love blue belt pushing lot competition every time step mat anxious almost afraid training like places gon na go ca know good bad think become better person experience like needed flip side like place got black belt balance studios remember also blue belt coach sitting going competition saw something said know like good luck win lose always love like remember really needed time like putting much pressure like actual professional competitor know competed like phd student like clearly psychological effect great coach like know like life important jiu jitsu since bigger find use jiu jitsu need grow person overwhelms pull person like look bigger picture always look bigger picture fascinating know make think would way anxiety love yeah think could really interesting thing describing guess kind brings back lot things discussing almost like reciprocal nature everything pressure great everyone happy time either mean let use example movies let say matrix course first one

public couch saying word way gon na get people side use right buzzwords use wrong buzzwords neat see people know way flip bird head think human meant think interact curious think thing recently know like hosting podcast sometimes think like talk terms like old hitler question hitler would definitely talk post world war ii everyone knows evil question whether talk hitler like people really students going understand dangerous human large part world like well leader cares germany question interesting involves particular person named also lives austin texas named alex jones know familiar guy familiar jones actually recently listened infra wars like one episode show guess every day kind reminded time college drank much tequila like turning back like like mistakes make like mean know gon na wake know gon na kill kill steal rob unclear felt like getting pulled dark place pretty much everybody pedophile trying control world bill gates definitely pedophile everybody power anybody power kind deep skepticism power conspiratorial way see world everything like dark forces corners like way feel kid monster hiding closet also leap bed like four feet away strategy yes says weak need look bed bed monsters need aware growing multiplying touching children touching children exactly connects listened thought like wan na talk podcast example listened conversation joe rogan two times talked somehow entertaining like fun listen fun listen madman go four hours almost like theater like talked joe people try censor alex jones joe says people try censor give enough credit intelligence human beings like understand like like person says large platform necessarily truth madman say crazy things people intelligent enough hear certain things said like earth flat intelligent enough sudden start believing earth flat like intelligent enough sort select different ideas able enjoy theater particular ridiculous top conversation without sort influenced way start believing like toxic set beliefs lot sort kinds people especially cancer culture say well wan na give platform crazy people ultimately whose beliefs might lead dangerous consequences like see often conspiracy theories go like way far like example looked sorry look hurts heart see bill gates opinion person saved improved lives probably human history literally money invested helping like work done like malaria africa number people helped huge yet every interview anything see bill gates everyone calling believe looked believe everyone calling pedophile know full structure feels like army like feels like hundreds thousands people feels like might much smaller percentage feels like huge number people calling pedophile flip side allow give platform conspiracy theories like start bigger bigger percent population believe crazy things wanted put know think put joe rogan shoes put shoes put shoes mean shoes right great staying shoes stay shoes word would talk would give platform people like alex jones would talk somebody like alex jones yes would feel strongly honestly well think interesting thing would say lot times understand clearly people would take issue idea guess proceed amplifying man voice man reach demonstrable negative think take step back cure damaging disease significantly guess think wary think wary mentioned alex jones wary power people lot times lot truth validity crazy things people say conspiracy theories stick ones sound credible least quasi credible aspect almost like seems like anchor people mind also funny obviously bill gates funny tar people things like pedophile racist rapist like things basically trying pick words one ever support someone things know changes year year currently pedophile totally thing call somebody used communist marxist cleveland browns fan know like come know would want actually nobody likes browns agree picked trick find group people nobody likes good right move yeah creepy thing though creepy thing like people always looking groups people always looking find really deeply disturbing like hey guy get away know treating like dirt guy dick walk punch face one gon na say anything even know people whether literal nazis someone called nazi know guess bigger issue person ridiculous beliefs mentioned hitler obviously mein kampf like outline things later evil always take root later flourish later adolf hitler problem crazy ideas things think think know things gon na start punishing thought crime gon na start punishing thought crime terrifying concept even right certain objectively correct things decide call bounds put charge made arbiter good taste long decide something else bounds always sliding scale always sliding standard find know concern people crazy things guess mentioned alex jones know putting ridiculous ideas ridiculous theories think people look alex jones credible person gon na pretend deeply read beliefs things trying peddle plenty things quasi mainstream think side side maybe comparably ridiculous know particularly hindsight know silly guess idea getting group people together decide going tolerate tricky thing think know reminds law know even know religion gets like things like feel rape like circumstances acceptable behavior murder acceptable behavior killing know kind depends situation war justified acting okay murder specific type killing way know things specific type something else guess draw line murder say want exist society ca done go theft someone said hey murdered guy understand coming might say yeah hear mean think right like ever wronged deeply could imagine could kill someone like could conceptualize someone like yeah okay still need go still need face know criminal justice system least decided yeah interesting able like look history discourse country think still true sure changed since used impossible criticize soldier easier criticize war harder criticize soldiers allowing tools war tend maybe russian upbringing combat thing tend romanticize war soldiers see soldiers heroes also heard people say soldiers war bad say soldiers bad argument kind libertarian view basically slaves evil right war evil given suspending moral ethical duties human become tools evil sort argument see war evil mean think useful hear long part history completely unacceptable abortion see abortion murder mean put basket starts living midst genocide looked perspective could feel people could deeply upset abortion go course looked different perspective say believe murder see go well genesis thought process like yeah okay see come different thing guess go well abortion murder period therefore support support murder convenient way tar right guess kind coming back alex jones nuance nuance kinds conversations willing conversation willing sit ca sit across violently racist angry hypothetical internet conceived person none us ever actually met real life hopefully go like well course believe person wrong allow change best hear go go point point explain guy girl wrong hopefully bring reasonable position better beliefs objectively better beliefs beliefs treat people better would wan na marginalize person might wan na talk might wan na invite barbecue acting like jerk time could would make world better place hear go look gon na sit talk gon na discussion hear say ca explain someone ridiculous belief wrong must confident position guess come back alex jones thing mentioned bill gates much familiar specifics good done unbelievable force good world list b c things man done foundation done positive things people could speculate ridiculous crazy levels evil ca produce evidence sort thing could man find trouble anyway guess would say ca force accept truth way could write two plus two equals four piece paper show works could say nah make true still given opportunity present case presented also anyone listening watching able critically assess gone critically address back forth discourse think making case public guess comes engaging people seems cowardly think something seeing society right think seeing crisis courage society place think seeing poor leadership think seeing understandable things happening everywhere need stronger voices stronger beliefs conviction willing engage others turning shouting contest win oh voted nice bullets saying mean right plenty horrible unpopular things deeply popular past would popular vote make right say clearly guess hope engage people best bring reasonable position believe one ca well least made effort think something martial arts shows value like know gon na go win next fight like idea proceed forward full effort fight dignity fight honor fight courage use everything play within bounds game result walk ring head held high know part job outcome specific outcome control strongly influence think something helped martial arts taught times even successful unsuccessful would focus therefore good lost therefore bad guy lost therefore opposed evaluating method think easy taking bird eye view things evaluate someone things evaluating process simply evaluating outcome could stumbled something good bad look back think value history mean mean get dang high horse like evaluate history see unbroken chain chain events led us somewhere eyes history truly evaluate things unless room watching happen guess start go big bad scary things happened history done particularly industrial scale implies governmental power things like equivalent involve groups people getting together going hey gon na deal guy giant groups people maybe right time maybe wrong next time guess would back gandalf putting one ring would hesitant even thought right simply try marginalize general principle even people like alex jones face pretty ridiculous like said sit adolf hitler talk men agree play little devil advocate please alex jones might bad example look face human real person also trolls internet chan worry folks might parallels martial arts practice guerrilla warfare meaning necessarily want arrive truth always want cut ankles powerful want always break powerful even turn everything game let see make world let see make trend bill gates pedophile right make game get excited game see powerful let see convince like positive person think let see turn evil tried like everybody seems stick good would argue whatever think current president elements figured whatever music social discourse going figured always troll mainstream like flow consciousness media always kind says stuff annoys large number people enjoys like taking powerful taking way things like shakes saying inappropriate thing almost purpose instinctually problem powerful thing brings power power notch great thing negative thing push us closer nuanced careful rigorous discourse towards truth like showing party like starting yell create good conversation makes everything game truth even seem like thing even hope achieve mean makes sense guess mentioned come back another movie books movies people wan na watch world burn right guess creepy creepy kind urge people also people like hey would like throw brick glass window like yeah sure like gon na think going occur like something gon na hurt someone property gon na versus hey wan na see happen like yeah sure kids always like son grabs drops table fell like fall sean like dropped knocked table grin basically interesting thing like said playing people appealing also almost like little dog factor like people wan na watch powerful get taken notch good good plenty people seems found way incredibly high positions found many many many many many people men women backgrounds brilliant worked hard yeah course luck luck everything lebron james spite best basketball player god green earth fortunate get hit car fortunate tear knee thankfully get see things guess people skin game never know gon na think problem internet people get nameless faceless guerrilla fighters outside bounds war like uniform like know get treatment soldier gets people go well crazy actually reasons otherwise people able assail things one responsible way go say hey come root address think problem internet problem twitter problem places like chan would mind seeing type stuff go away frank thing people face people willing stand say hi name even ridiculous beliefs hopefully people hear wrong educate guess hope real guess mind antidote silliness education think something critical thinking necessarily went school america feel fortunate critical thinking something focused mean tough almost like talking jujitsu tough teach critical thinking know words teach techniques ca teach artist recognize techniques beginning end ultimately artistry searching science memorization guess hope people ability think critically recognize majority rule whoever loudest mean right stretch imagination appeal bow help help inoculate ridiculous things come places dark places objectively great guess circling back even swatted bad things existence right got careful swatting political group power right people support current president would maybe feel certain way people support another option would feel differently exactly defines toxic guess gives pause yeah also grace thing tend believe technology said education platforms use like twitter reddit platforms role play teach us grace meaning help us incentivize kind behavior incentivized real life like dick real life incentivized like interaction cases usually kind incentivized internet like get likes mocking people funny humorous way dark kind mocking depending community go appearance somebody little fat little skinny comment appearance hair way hair looks like appearance stuff could people comment time level eloquence speech go fuck like creepy though watching previously like used lowbrow though like people type stuff creepy watching like political figures get type game yes little bit refreshing right hope donald trump would shake people wear suits usually like dc remember like showing actually wear usually wear dc cause like everybody wearing suit tie like giving talks stuff except mudge wears jeans mudge give damn said mudge forever renegade even remember oh yeah hope trump huge shake system say like inject new ideas inject new energy course way turned different like turns might wan na somebody like andrew yang type character full ideas different inject energy new energy system youthful new ideas versus troll like good sort mocking like playing outside rules game trump reveal powerfully know think game play rules inspiring dark deeply depressing right yeah know mean drawing parallels drawing parallels president adolf hitler certainly lot history lot positive lot negative things happen charismatic leaders realize play rules flip table kevin spacey show oh house cards house cards flip table whatever play rules chess game flip table one wonders always done private know guess cause mean even look obviously united states republic bush clinton bush president obama another clinton fairly creepy yeah even added another mean sure generation trumps gee know russian think humans like kings still queens something attracted thing talked coaches something us longs towards authoritarian control one beautiful things america second amendment also like individual freedom one unique aspects founding country still beacon hope somehow fire freedom burns like texas feel gives hope fu energy revolts power discussed power corrupts ultimately leads sort degradation whoever ruling people interesting though seems maybe know reading properly see seems like said flip bird gon na within reason like long hurting idea much least mind defines american ideal least part consciousness united states attack certain extent like think like maybe generation behind us becoming collectivist good also good terms policy point terms like consciousness wonder internet thing people touch one another far tell ever least lifetime rest world seems much closer living virginia california seems far away internet right hear see interact people remember tennessee one time reading events taking place middle east seemed like mile away seemed like unbelievably far distance another time dc feel like oh read something happening paris feels like right around corner dc seat power things occurring time guess wonder come back group decisions listen person cancel moral majority shall following opposed long hurting long hurting anyone else let let general principle even like free like free speak within right would right attempt attack interesting thing though see words redefined words defined whether toxicity whether violence think saying speech violence precursor violence justified sorts things creeps significantly even ends pointed good direction initially matter time actually brings dune quote oh yeah got day much paying say frank herbert estate enough frankly let see many books dune jen question also fan jen read whole series couple read prequels well exception couple book one dune dune would book one even prequels still better start like read dune read original six went back started read like watching star wars wan na start episode

mandalorian fine recent movies like talk oh name goofy guy creature goofy creature jar jar yeah jar jar ever see jar jar binks actually dark lord sith theory fixed whole initial trilogy like like goofing around like making way battles like wait minute oops way walks pool triple back flip falls like bizarre alex jones theory star wars like actually running everything one actually like hey vote chancellor palpatine senator palpatine like right put jar jar charge first think gon na happen second would think great like oops oh man guess emperor would great actually cancel stuff hope gives pause think fighting lot times use example people like fight fans like ufc love people run try murder entertaining super entertaining floyd mayweather resonate people much like people started remember time floyd popular people think people love floyd floyd oh man finally much success ca help recognize man genius greatness prior oh boring fights circumspect cautious pressing intelligent deeply intelligent watch people go try murder flip coin hundred times lucky enough get hundred heads still coin flip think going time people getting outcome want situation win five row knockout lose three row people go well happened guy used great like always getting great outcomes coin flip prior getting negative outcomes coin flip guess would say interesting watching guess societal beliefs become thing almost adopting religious level careful say religious level mean like pan life like guiding choices good bad dune quote religion politics travel car writers believe nothing stand way movements become headlong faster faster faster put aside thoughts obstacles forget precipice show man blind rush late think pause go oh man thank goodness guy wants rebuild germany put us back need stop questioning judgment start stop thinking essentially right allowed question oh well course correct course correct course right intended right course actions correct mean many times us intended something helpful ended something less plenty people intend harm could accident something decent guess saying anything terribly terribly insightful one hard say moment hopefully caution would counsel degree caution worries people deciding right right attempting rather win argument silence counter argument matter crazy may seem think idea even pointed good direction initially matter time amongst many things jujitsu black belt one things people really curious white belts blue belts jujitsu also people tried art take jujitsu black belt think everyone journey little bit different one thing calvin coolidge quote determination persistence thing win end always win end brilliance toughness education persistence think belief matter happens proceed forward figure make happen hell high water think one thing ties together people ever met made whatever going sometimes get lucky easy time luck could good situation could mean like obvious sense like living training going good situation unbelievably athletic oh gon na astronaut brilliant olympic athlete know like well fantastic situation know genetic lottery worked hard well also genetic lottery determination one thing though person could easy go initially tear knee longer superhuman physical specimen thing keep going persistence think would say persistence say put one foot front sometimes see path ahead sometimes beyond vision

hensler team obviously fantastic things john really really great innovation systematization methodology using great neat see getting would also would encourage people make sure know catching history obviously know john brilliant instructor done things know sport fantastic done know none us exist vacuum learned things everywhere else know john would say sure know dean lister would say neat kind trace history happening humanity two arms two legs time least long alive mentioned like airplanes think something totally new invented jiu jitsu still totally new like know flying new airplanes nevertheless made much efficient like new ideas discovered jiu jitsu still say reason say yes reason would say believe alchemy even though serious like got backing okay know guess talk buddy mine lot like facilitative versus facilitative beliefs believe something possible investigation towards never find something even almost like different walking group people going like oh man look jerks gon na suck versus going oh wonder guys two different conversations even though players game different internal constitution changed decided approach situation although would personally want spend time trying turn lead gold believe likely work person willing spend life pursuit actually get bottom also pursuit likely find things think lot times idea humanity pushed forward another orson scott carb like human beings slog paraphrasing slog time periodically humanity gives birth genius like someone invents wheel invents electricity pushes us forward comes idea governance start end point sword common things unbelievable advancements sitting come get benefit guess would say lot times ideas called crazy like discussed kind offline like einstein brilliant brilliant would suspect basically gets recognized later life course thought great ideas man probably roundly mocked giant chunks life guess neat would say definitely mind things even combinations new new ways see things new ways understand different depth understanding possibly new things new positions new ideas even true process going acting believing like focusing trying investigate make us push us forward whereas sitting obsessing cult current knowledge think biggest danger biggest cause stagnation exists anywhere yeah starts believing impossible kind interesting one things really inspiring see people sadly rare kind combination two things one worldview involves includes lot ideas crazy second part exceptionally focused competent bringing whatever ideas worldview reality certainly lot people crazy ideas lot conspiracy theorists way beliefs things much like make like build stuff grounded like engineers whatever like espousing different crazy ideas get like elon musk type characters reason bring lot like many others bring like many examples history people mean guys convinced going colonize mars basically everybody earth thinks insane everyone except guy gon na right except gon na like imagine like couple hundred years people mean first wo certainly wo remember haters wo remember people remember remember sense like people silly think obvious path forward like perspective elon talks like obvious going expand throughout universe like perspective perspective like also obvious like either destroy expand beyond earth like many know well maybe completely obvious guess share worldview possibility humans find sort inner peace forces capitalism calm meditate yoga jujitsu like relax whole tech thing keep building new technologies cool kinds people believe big ambitious crazy dreams starts want build something special first believe also believe strongly enough vulnerable speculating like imagine many people told elon crazy dream dreamed went also went face told going work also stepped away bitterness done series really crazy impressive things little things aware also staying away bitterness every single time something good initially talk eventually act course course never apologize yet let dampen spirits next innovation pretty incredible watch yeah kind cool mean contagious spend time guy rogan look interesting people like hater shield like even like sense feels like thinks elon obvious mean keeps calling like first principles thinking like physics says true therefore true like convinced like beliefs grounded fundamental fabric way universe works therefore haters matter mean kind like system thought developed difficulty doubt able take huge risks basically putting everything owes line multiple times throughout life mean drama doubts like still able make clear headed decisions know make inspiring hell well think something funny think like imagine history look back brilliant person lot maybe numeric statistically speaking lot numerically giant planet billions people lot brilliant people well time place luck fortune stuff time clearly determining thing making elon musk elon musk obviously know guy adam interesting thing intellect belief system structure viewing world like reason way factors came really curious guess coming feel really strongly people belief structure view world important engine behind makes someone resilient makes someone positive could think competitive stuff could things going properly one thing going improperly focus improper probably fix certain point good facilitative development long term go try perform task next five minutes focusing negative confidence belief positive outcome future likely damaged whereas could things going wrong go man sure happy alive fortunate great problems solve awesome versus list problems start bitching technically accurate guess different lenses think really neat thing see someone exemplifying us maybe look fighting world million questions ask like one mentioned bj penn first undefeated ufc one fights bj penn kind incredible fight performance night feel like face bj penn beat definitively like whole experience like honest know going ever able fight beating gray maynard couple periods join army actually ufc jen sent ultimate fighter want go like one never going pick two terrible tv three probably say something going get burned death streets like great idea said go see happens anyway regret ended ultimate fighter fought three times show fought finale four times like five six months great took year get another opponent gray maynard gray obviously tough guy managed get good outcome took two years fight bj penn obviously training time every single day never stops honest pretty deeply frustrating human athlete think athlete die twice like athletic peak area go rest life bit mystery microcosm rest life like seeing sand tick away hourglass drop away going man years best time absolute best physically technically lot better planet certain point unless bernard hopkins reach diminishing returns guess long wait feel clock ticking frustrating like take two years bj question people ask lot like nobody want fight right know probably think get infected whatever blame mean really tough opponent bottom line say different maybe perceive threat greater reward hoping ranked number ufc rankings change know one win top consistently found like randoms want fight like go away come wanted fight anybody could go waffle house yell like dmx shows fight waffle house kidding really want hang dmx like want ryan hall dmx waffle house oh god cool would sounds like netflix show something would never fight dmx team anyway guess accepted fights got asked lamas said yes got asked dennis bermudez said yes know like long periods time time well know struggling opponents would sign turned fights said hey know keep care fighting randoms successful school like running martial artist broadly speaking make sense take fights right fit certain kind trajectory career bj penn said well bj looking opponent like guy think know bj accepted fight another guy think perceived much threat feet know able neat get compete someone know one heroes one people looked mma longest time intimidated love competing really get nervous scared fights afraid get hurt afraid win afraid lose excited feel thankful opportunity compete opportunity play matters know time interested playing anymore matters opposition know know funny people pick lot opponents particularly fact like get good outcome well oh course lex beat guy guy good like well fact get say also person ring know bj penn hurt lot people mixed martial arts cage could actually absolutely list neat get compete someone really respect someone looked long time someone great skillset also went weight fight weight class come mine take lightweight lightweight yeah generally featherweight walk around like pounds lightweight featherweight lightweight day weighing featherweight day weighing little bit properly sized featherweight anyway know feel like obviously giving couple years age giving size stuff know excited opportunity step someone like bj know managed get good outcome without getting banged cool tied fence even second know rolling somebody touch feel go oh man guy really good feel calm feel small minor adjustments making subtle things one things really neat gratifying know never know sometimes people heard little bit less technically proficient thought times meet guy train like hell guy heard person bj exactly guy would thought another thing another thing bugged people reacted fight know basically going oh bj screwed screwed like right yeah tell interesting sad know one mean fan beautiful moment kind passing torch sense exceptional performance like another one stands maybe comment understand well maybe conor mcgregor gets much hate probably revels think get enough credit jose aldo like basically know knocking first seconds fight mean jose like one greatest fighters ever true maybe people could even put top question like understand get much like conor mcgregor get much credit know conor mcgregor get much credit think deserves eddie alvarez fights reason whenever conor mcgregor beats somebody well good like means like something right convenient yeah quite strange mean thoughts conor mcgregor maybe one way ask russian obviously also khabib fan also conor fan seems like many us like fans right thoughts artem lobov two us also good fight tough dude yeah really really tough dude especially like five languages really interesting cat oh oh wow know side brain well khabib versus conor make first fight agree fight think would awesome fought moscow agree gon na put say things piss people believe conor actually chance beat khabib one conor absolutely chance beat khabib conor chance beat anyone steps ring like mathematical chance like oh one billion like know like absolutely funny wo pretend know conor really well first met conor teaching seminar straight blessed gym ireland dublin actually first met coaches ended conor team john kavanaugh owen roddy gunnar nelson actually enjoyed ultimate fighter team getting train guys time people actually knew better actually european side conor coaches neat thing got met conor know conor conor conor point yeah ufc division oh yeah well yeah think got like maybe something like yeah anyway well cage warriors winning titles think prior know remember going seeing show also getting see train competed initially slated fight david tamer ultimate fighter finale getting put fight artem title show went ireland train couple days basically neat watch work mean man focused trains lot smart hardworking think lot times people get stuck know almost want believe lucky person know working hard got mouth case know know like know obviously conor well right know hard serious training ca speak question skills dangerous one funny things obviously could fight could way could great fighter also chance beat anyone ring given time conor know one put anybody away mentioned think get credit eddie alvarez fight get credit jose aldo fight almost much letdown remember happened weekend ultimate fighter finale like wait yeah almost feel like fight happened mentioned miyamoto musashi mean musashi famous way poked prodded people whether overtly like oh supposed fight death know tomorrow great rolls around five mean remember antics nonsense conor pulling prior like speaking personally something would feel comfortable like everyone different effect jose mean beyond evident last time jose started fight leaping left hand leaping right hand like wait obviously know living rent free jose head point combination psychological ability wherewithal physical reminded way muhammad ali would bother people whatnot fact polarizing figure think makes people give due time sometimes certain fans maybe go overboard remember knee ben askren got knocked masridal mean amazing unbelievable thing three inches right three inches left guess whichever side head could square fight starts ben askren top first five seconds well conor ran knee like could even could got right around could easily gone way imagine would happened coming back boxing coming back mayweather fight conor rocks could first seconds like would would intolerable yeah see thing let actually push back slightly mean fans correct wrong conor seems competed lot tension negativity sometimes depending opponent respect afterwards happens understand deep respect almost like love always seen conor trash talk afterwards subtle thing ca always see respect agree almost khabib side almost feel like khabib really took personally lost respect conor thought whole time conor respect wanted say like conor fight like rock khabib could see like would see trash talking could see like trash talking stop right think time sure recall like conor conor crossing pretty personal territory religiously also familiarly khabib mean think sort thing know interesting one reasons well depends like know difference obviously know khabib dagestani people play around like play around like know mean take offense basically mean like conor maybe purpose maybe even aware totally fair cultural differences box opened like talk floyd mayweather go anywhere say offensive things hard lines yeah hard lines mean lot people ask know featherweight face feels like khabib one hardest puzzles solve mixed martial arts face khabib think would go solving puzzle like almost question almost perspective guy exceptionally good controlling position especially top good wrestling taking controlling position like let say forget maybe striking ground solve guy like guard get taken create entire system getting taken escaping like ideas well guess would say mind fighting game trading energy kind two things damage energy like say energy mean like tired tired much gas got damage counts obviously well could feeling could feeling great get kick head hard really hard three times matter could get run mile ca get anyway think khabib well makes fight look like khabib magomedov fight great job avoiding damage feet part really sucking life people suffocating oppressive control chain wrestling good anyone ever seen ufc fantastic poses really serious threat people need maintain certain amount space try hurt feet unless able inflict adequate amount damage gon na time let say instance let say taking conclusion point every single time khabib takes get right back big deal actually experienced let say rolling tap times one round tired probably ass badly like one working comfortable like taken get hurt badly tired bottom chance involve cracking feet gets ahold lot lot ask lot ask difficult seemed actually connor seemed like kind taken take attempts khabib seemed somewhat relaxed whole thing thought well actually think particularly first round thought good job one things think like khabib fights taking place khabib world large part mean set aside one giant right hand khabib hit connor way connor reacted like absolute champion got crushed overhand drop eyes went right back khabib immediate positive great response even though think bit surprising thing connor reacted really really well gon na bottom khabib four rounds gon na tough also connor way better grappler people like give credit type grappler tall order grapplers could least would much much better shot able weather type storm see able relaxed kind storm yes well guess ca remember savagely beaten relaxing timing answer like okay dumb question ultimately goal jiu jitsu relaxed fire sure remember like every ufc fighter win hypothetical matchups yeah sure true since one ask ridiculous questions talking kind stuff let ask kind big question everybody disagrees certainly top five greatest mma fighters time oh man fedor number one okay well first fedor number one oh really oh yeah right really oh yeah talk people get completely underappreciated even though never succeeded ufc fault came along time fedor height ufc heavyweight fighting mean good heavyweights fedor unbelievable mean remember minotaro noguera massive fan still remember watching pride noguera fought cro cop got blasted left kick dropped like seconds left first round pride great minute first round five minute second materially alters fight big time texture fight borderline different sport getting five pause five anyway similar sports like one swimming things nine gold medals different types swimming right still swimming anyway well yeah would disagree yeah mean trying specialize totally true minutes different five minutes sorry take drown swimmers swim well easy downplay anyway yeah better john jones like modern era well mean guess tough compare across eras would like going saying like oh man would great grappler today fair someone like well probably pretty well depending upon going know people would skillsets might transition across eras lot times fair get like comparing spartans modern day know like army guys like well gon na win like well modern day army guys get modern day weapons well yeah toughest ruggedest group people least guess tough say least mind people think great fighters quality opposition level like lasting like success level lasting innovation like courage demonstrate like big fish small pond takes courage mean nothing requires something little bit different kazushi sakuraba one guys bj penn also mean bj penn fought lyoto machida insane know time different sport different time sport know guys bouncing around different things let guess gracie family mean never like obviously hoist never definitely different sport weight classes open things like say hoist one greatest ever think would sitting talking gracie family whole mean better mean think hoist would tell probably hickson would handled business back put greatest fighter greatest fighter greatest fighter saw business hoist sure like nobody seems agree like connects soccer messi seems people value like long champion many like defenses championship successfully highly value singular moments genius like like like look conor mcgregor guess held champion long much well defend either title right defend either titles like messi look lionel messi moments brilliance unlike history conor messi people seem give credit like well many world cups like arbitrary world cup thing championship thing think easier people wrap head around right like nfl combine mean tom yeah numbers something well go pick tom brady first round know works call genius pick tom brady first round combine work get fired never hired work somewhere else like insulating criticism think almost go numbers well bench presses like many times guys like super studs nfl combine ever greatest players nfl history nfl history like zero close zero even certainly correlation funny though think like many days hold title ah title reign x times longer means nothing wanted find greatest fighter ever like said think individual moments like like transcendent different something else people win lose number different reasons interesting thing blame argentina winning world cup messi know fair know many times mean use remember trent dilfer quarterback baltimore ravens strong defense trying pick trent dilfer like strong defense make ray lewis know chris mcallister era know super bowl think anyone going say know trent dilfer better quarterback know put category dan marino got got super bowl many times let use march madness super bowl love like guy always makes finals never gets done let get straight getting finals nine times count win end game saying would better guy game got hump well many times finals zero like right interesting yeah obsessed numbers like well cause ca assess method right think time us ca assess method anything like oh look guy x swimming like know michael phelps great know faster ca look technique say anything well way better anything know ca say difference next guy guess wonder like need concrete identifier lot times people like saying know people wo put like ronda rousey top even like changed almost anybody else changed martial arts history know even think exaggerating made okay women fighters yeah like changed way see like one great feminists time way yeah weird kind way like know maybe ronda rousey fan yeah conversation cause start converting numbers well many win among greatest fighters greatest things know mean think something mean obviously ronda great judoka competing mma time lot girls like get skills olympics oh get high school like yeah gon na olympic girls gon na beat guess diminish accomplishment fedor diminished fact would like fight stephen miocis right probably would go great john jones exists like knock fedor accomplishments say oh bj penn let say mixed record point somehow invalidates things done guess kind brings us back lot people talked fact brilliant people throughout history love monsters throughout history rightly revile lot cases complicated people legacy one thing someone something amazing invalidate mean anything bad someone terrible things mean invalidate positives guess fighting urge put people one category think people get depressed oh good right oh bad right versus hey work progress trying x number things legacy tough thing figure anyway speculative last time reddit said last time experience much fear fights like ask couple mike tyson things okay interesting maybe weird know seen clip tyson talking feels leading fight kind overtaken fear gets closer closer closer ring confidence grows dad seen clip aware okay seen let play george pierre said something similar one time dressing room five minutes come gloves laced breaking gloves pushing lever back leg breaking middle glove knuckle pierced lever feel knuckle piercing tight leather gloves everlast boxing glove come supreme confidence scared death totally afraid afraid everything afraid losing afraid humiliated totally confident closer get ring confidence get closer confidence get closer confidence get training afraid man thought man might capable beating dreamed beating always stayed afraid closer get ring confident ring god one could beat god mean first cognizant demons whatever hell ideas violence interesting something tension describing confident scared resonates hold idea kind spoken really afraid appreciate saying think speak feeling concerned let say instance feel certain way think people lot like computers like admit lot times ca parse going mean make sense see think least times like concerned situation person something happening prior fight like reason reason push bury reason like thought done missing feeling way mentioned prior like feeling like well certain aspects life mentioned think comes competing think right job trying learn better going like well feel way reason okay thinking wrong way adequately prepared something address maybe four hours night like extra hours thinking addressed watching sparring watching watching thinking things accurately addressed concern feel concern kind dissipate guess honestly thought comes know gon na die certain point obviously gon na get hurt mean pain happens pain loss would nothing compared pain injury would nothing compared pain running away guess think value like feel like winner every single time step ring fight everything ca promise win next fight know skills tools beat anyone grappling mixed martial arts point know certain trained enough people compete enough people know stand also know perfect also better fighter even perceive thing win night man fights better wins night give credence mind person one value versus going process path going thinking behaving focus process respect opponent respect respect anyone behaves certain level consistency could win plenty winners history shitbags plenty losers winning make bad good person losing make good default either bad default think truth socially truth know athletically know academically primal fear though like primal fear getting hurt running away facing threat bigger pain pain experience fight pretty powerful violence mean face like know also seen tyson talk rogan recently talking trying psychoanalyze enjoys violence much mean called orgasmic know seen clip okay playing cause need cause trump also retweeted hilarious know contextualize president retweeted clip tyson maybe like gon na like gon na throw curve ball one gon na idea yeah explanation go go well think kind like describing like give answer good one better let imagination run exactly yeah like kubrick time really interesting sometimes periodic real sometimes struggle fact possibility really hurt somebody like wan na hurt mean struggle possibility could hurt sometimes orgasmic sometimes yeah like fights like particularly like tyrell biggs someone problems someone joe getting animosity towards finally get hands hey mean fighting gets erect mean good question means getting excited yeah going mind right well get kid sometimes get twinkle twinkle yeah well saying like reached state human champion ferocious fighter reached state ability accomplishment humans ever touch feel asking running hitting bag heart beating know mike motherfucking tyson shit still mike tyson thoughts got ta burning inside got ta pretty wild know wild believe rightfully way know think mastered know deal let overwhelm mean goes try ever like joe bite well interesting thing conversation mike trying figure yeah like trying spot like feel way like real honest feel like pleasure hurting somebody like rarely hear society like rarely like talk like feel pleasure winning feel pleasure like relief overcoming like stress go pleasure like specifics fight techniques use maybe overcoming couple rounds like often hear somebody say enjoyed even saying hate opponent saying like enjoyed purely violence crazy mean know honest made ask like wonder many us cognizant say mike uncommonly seemingly honest think athletes make job line people make job line fair mean tell tell others feel need maybe whether even know feel need mean run hit somebody sign sign well interesting thing dyson weird behavior mean fighting style another degree like else jiu jitsu paul harris kind weirdness like like fear think opponents would longer takes realm game takes us back thing talking strips away several layers ryan hall podcast guest ryan hall jiu jitsu instructor ryan hall jiu jitsu competitor keeps going point ryan hall murderer things get way lies underneath seemingly like society put aside makes wonder like society tested many ways makes wonder like underneath well want answer guess seen paul fiction best character movie best scene movie like questions call answer scary cease asking scary questions guess wonder mean us something think funny go oh okay mean versus maybe appropriate situation x z make us think mean humanity different place saying anything crazy humanity different place years ago us descended people killed things teeth fingernails order whether whether animal conflict another person mean think chances dying violence slim least countries places like shockingly small thankfully period time like period time dying violence mostly went guess would facilitative would allow win back ender game allows ca forever subject people real thing fortunate find situation things matter funny thing periodically people see people kind drawing like videos world clearly neither expect get serious like gon na yell gon na yell like weird larping thing gon na go separate way takes one person like well kidding like oh go jail like oh know gon na go morgue happen like like society mean obviously anyway could jump across table stab eye mean appreciate hope consequences rest society potentially get certain point decide play rules time want fascinating yeah created rules based behave underneath know things motivations forces play rules still nature metal surface seriously pull phone basically saying like hey gon na gon na get caught really antagonizing rightly wrongly know mean like interesting thing feel like people need remember us need remember reason one step away times ever people say like oh feel safe like safe kill get room nothing stop nothing mean worry means like oh thank goodness imagine like many guns country like mean everywhere mean seriously everywhere heartening thought way cause people usually freak go oh god gun violence gun violence gun violence like really serious issue united states compared could means mean amount guns amount bullets circulation imagine like one every thousand used anger day mean would terrifying place live could go anywhere mean although could say hey like x actually means people much reasonable sane saying sometimes might might argue guess mean like oh man walked get stabbed like oh well good protected karate basically one decided run stab protecting stopped guess fortunate live society like said nature metal become big issue time funny get people ring go hey let peel back tyson many layers say hey okay cool mean society lived harvard square add extra layers safe means like discourse safe spaces like ideas violence like yeah ideas minor slights personality violence like extra layers around nature metal thing cool progress ca forget like underneath still thing murder drop moment aroused one thing find funny though ironic maybe words violence offenses violence thing course belief justifies violence like whether maybe physical violence response aggressive response things guess like gets aggressive response like kind tit tat sort situation goes like well one get ca anything morality saying might makes right guess understand people certain progress aspect guess without proper examination effectively friends force law mike people admitting least mike tyson honest afraid death mean easy say sit probably die like ufc question defeat opponent exactly answer yes answer course yes around yeah exactly mean ponder mortality maybe another context mentioned two deaths martial artists think actually honestly even though relatively young age think mortality something aware maybe average person think probably athletes speak anyone trouble managed slide couple experiences personally mostly idiot regret nothing yeah thank god yeah interesting seeing end seeing going well gon na happen guess think comes back kind discussing belief structure belief system think lot times recognize matter gon na end one day go well would gon na make idea like hope idea gon na make age gon na make much control much mean funny interesting like back belief structure like internal external locus control facilitative versus true think accepting personal responsibility control probably positive time recognizing much control fortunate enough born united states fortunate enough knock wood serious disease aware right showed really fortunate guess diminish fact tried make decent choices works concert guess go death want right think easier relatively calm staring face would care lot live control ca control walk building helicopter falls worrying ca control maybe cancer know really hope something meditating fact could end today

level like practicing hard unpleasant listening magnus episode like read books much one thing said like normal studying classical chess interest says suck puzzles like puzzles yeah enjoy like purely driven passion think internet like suck puzzles yeah liked could grandmaster study fun think lesson really powerful spends day thinking chess wants whatever getting better chess whatever takes actually number hours spend day thinking chess maximize like super serious actually get addicted whenever start studying chess seriously focused content cause go rabbit holes focusing chess wan na good possibly game otherwise hard enjoy cause competitive thing remember training tournaments training tournaments even start dreaming chess stop thinking flipped completely different world also like best game completely different living experience take drugs start see things ceiling factual hallucination like queen gambit like scenes think based life story well ca say camera kidding actually chess players careful take drugs drink lot yeah drink much actually crazy good able play chess comes things like psychedelics things usually stay away cause wan na mess anything brain actually intervention saw mentioned somewhere think lie detector test drinking problem think actually meme like joke stream occasionally like white claw stream something like people meme goes back andrea point amplifying part personality make little bit entertaining gon na use excuse podcast amplifying part personality really like played drunk magnus played drunk says helps someone creativity truth well andrea would never would never played drinking actually enjoy playing chess drinking going club drinking sounds really silly usually play opponents also beer make feel like seeing game fresher perspective sometimes make feel confident liquid confidence help creativity feel like could pull things also limit like one drink two drink goes beyond start missing tactics worth yeah think helps players short time controls one time challenging grandmaster stream playing bullet chess one minute chess giving handicaps said take four shots next game got like times stronger transformed hulk destroyed last game course playing three hour game gon na get old think short time controls amazing yeah definitely blitz intuition rather sitting calculating probably negatively affecting ability calculate absolutely yeah much guys play look chess board much calculation much intuition much memorized openings really depends short form chess five minutes three minutes one minute classical chess favorite play love playing blitz actually got chess streaming could spend entire weekends weeks playing tournaments would college log play long blitz bullet sessions fast time go calculate deeply basically calculate short lines pretty quickly lot pattern recognition intuition three minutes said three minutes yeah okay cool basically intuition lot intuition yeah see saw streams actually keep talking playing chess seems really difficult yeah helps result help results hurts helps content game yeah exactly still cause feels like possibly concentrate talking much intuition talking thinking topic come board understand sometimes get trouble cause talking lost half time minute half opponent three kind disadvantage kind goes show blitz chess usually works whereas classical different better chess mean let way andrea say way alex stronger way weaker physically terms chess well yes course higher rated play think strengths really gets end game stronger end game actually stronger opening soon able simplify supposed say good know getting well see worry related okay cause get advantage beginning game soon starts trading pieces like confidence drops know end game hardest part game longest ends beating end game think really makes difference sounds like psychological warfare better cause getting nervous definitely harder play higher rated players know magnus former world champions psychological edge think always going different andrea cause knows statistically winning something like one four games usually better cause distracting talks lot help feel like play higher rated player experience like playing somebody like magnus depends much higher rated someone like andrea let say point difference know win least still feel like chance playing title tuesday tournament every tuesday got really lucky beat gm drew international master got paired hikaru nakamura brain went blank cause know unlikely win could even play game properly much difference winning like time like psychological saying biggest experience like actually knowing numbers statistically thinking way win meant like suffocating feeling like positionally feel like constantly attack feel like slowly getting outsmarted worst even know wrong come like thought great got slowly squeezed understand going kind baffled kind like watching alphazero beat stockfish really understand making certain moves thought plan see slowly getting position better feels like would add kind different someone significantly higher rated let say like points playing magnus notice feel lost straight soon know preparation know many opening lines gon na know best line beat studied move like already maybe plus advantage really small someone significant skill level know already lost point like third game strengths weaknesses andrea andrea good opening preparation said said likes bringing mean meticulous really go learn lines initial starting confidence helpful opening helps develop plans middle game think good think actually pretty good tactical combinations tactics tactics like solving puzzles basically finding lines forced find going win like puzzles within position yeah exactly whereas strategic chess making slow moves process like moves get slightly better position based understanding overall strategy extensive research wikipedia says played opening king indian defense quote black allows white advance pawns center board first two moves truth king indian probably played opening one even coach grandmaster taught like know playing king indian years still understand one openings computers really like least stockfish like maybe alphazero would change mind forgot look show way yeah white opening black opening black responds queen pawn push take knight put stereotypical classical king indian say actually famous king indian game notes prepared okay asked record asked guys games find pretty cool maybe get chance talk yeah king indian see white much control center white three pawns center black none past fifth rank pawn one ideas chess taking center plan revolves around trying continually challenge really fun king indian black sometimes gets crazy king side attacks white gets queen side attacks even though little bit suspicious black computer could usually break hard defend human attacked pull attack black gon na end lost end game like asymmetrical position asymmetrical although lot people stop playing classical king indian even though computers give big advantage play slower lines king indian less fun play slower mean takes longer time something interesting basically let get much king side attack try opening center weaknesses slowly improving position pieces instead able go king side attack people listening white pawns fourth row row together feels like bad position black white oh like taking center like taking center talking trash already oh sorry feel vulnerable row together gon na defend guess nice defend queen defends actually talking theme see sometimes called hanging pawns two pawns right next pawns defend valid point actually black trying break apart pawns get push create holes position trade lot chess openings get space also end protect pawns potentially move forward point overextended plus pawns vulnerable kind fun like stuff danger like everything like trapped like ca anything everything blocked yeah blocked yeah like ca fun yeah one opening principles white get pawns center say like actually preferable white let go opening principles clue good learning lesson chess beginners audience okay first thing wan na control center go e aggressive one like basic vanilla move somebody told popular opening move chess considered aggressive e king pawn known tactical players whereas known positional players considered aggressive tactical gambits e think tactical means gon na try attack gon na try go puzzles rely combination abilities whereas something positional usually like three four moves good position whereas tactics need see one line precise one cool queen come bishop come yeah one popular checkmates usually teach new students try cheese friends feel really excited know new trap bring bishop queen try checkmate trap queens gambit beth harmon falls first game versus janitor gets mad gets checkmated early oh one gets checkmated yeah okay love guys actually paying attention games carefully pretty cool good job evolving game throughout show actually represent actual growth chess player yeah really took every detail consideration cool okay else brought stuff center okay wan na develop pieces beginning game wan na take bishops knights first wan na start valuable piece like queen become vulnerability get attacked early reason taking two pieces first wan na castle king move knight move bishop move considered developing yeah stage like even getting pawns usually wan na start getting pawn wan na get space center also push pawns helps free pieces usually start one pawn first could start taking minor pieces bishop knight anxiety pawn floating defenseless attacked yet see call ghost threats scared something happened yet attack feel like deeper thing going yeah actually let say yeah attacking pawn center vulnerable soon develop knight defend well okay people listening two pawns came meet couple knights love chess cup poetic yeah pawns met midnight yeah yeah gon na romanticize game bit exactly okay cool bring bishops knights matching black going match whatever attacking yep developing gon na defend could develop bishop knight whenever like oh give options oh right yeah go attacking pawn center afraid let see defend symmetrical thing bringing knight side actually move good well defending pawn freeing space bishop basically trying develop pieces quickly possible put pawns center get king safety usually basic opening tips get kind counterintuitive safety corner board king true always confusing know three pawns front though typically push maybe like one maybe go one square like wall defense keep safe another way also think pieces usually want point towards center knight closer center closer side actually squares go huge part wanting flexibility pieces go pieces going able make threats center even open position since likely open want king somewhere position stay close pawns defend know like rules like wondering built chess engines start wonder like positionally things good like built intuition wish thing would amazing engines could explain kind thing better kind thing start build intuition like nothing chess feels confusing cornering king like getting like trapped like feels like could get checkmated easier using like dumb intuition seems like case imagine maybe alphazero learned playing games right imagine lot games build intuition keep king center see games dealing threats lot often yeah shortcut rules even mean best way play chess seen alphazero kind changing rules game little bit human learn scratch lot difficult start principles beginners usually learn chess way yeah playing humans humans also operated different principles people come training engines going much better people past gon na try weirder ideas go principles old gon na weird stuff including sacrifices stuff like yeah also think alphazero shocking stockfish using opening database already based knowledge humans playing chess years thought supposed play whereas alphazero learned playing game many times came novel opening ideas impressed alphazero seen games seen games think impressed bewildered motivated three things experienced like think magnus said also impressed could easily mistaken creativity trash talk towards ai beautiful sentence listening podcast mean human agree wan na give machine power creativity looks creative give compliment fair know nice machines case ever looking back else principles opening go little bit forward let say finish full development positions like let say developed pieces like really nice like nobody took pieces nice positional thing yeah actually accurate one actually could put different one board usually developed pieces wan na get queen little bit connect rooks also start thinking certain pawn pushes getting space another good tip improve position pieces think timing already moved piece piece moved wan na focus piece moved able likely jump game right move pieces multiple times exactly like try move optimal position yeah yeah makes sense indian think kind went ever say like much cause weird cause king side liked fun aggressive defense throwing pieces towards white many sacrificing opportunities reason tactical games always feel like beautiful satisfying liked kings indian also suffered lot love would play things necessarily correct attack would pan would struggle rest game play trying defend always wikipedia also says known attacking play also known losses according stanford okay let bring see wikipedia talk trash says nice things yeah wikipedia lot nicer actually played lot positional chess classic cause really liked slow squeeze transitioned playing lot online chess almost looking instant gratification cause feels much better beat someone attack even sometimes pan okay cause get many games think style online chess really changed classical chess andrea style attacking like conservative defensive player chaotic opening wise like play positionally like like push slowly improve pieces slowly get attack like alex said playing bullet chess blitz viewers often like wan na play riskier moves may good kind would play aggressive enjoy tournaments reason cause like moves soon prep like sitting thinking positional yeah positional middle games one games found pretty cool hikaru nakamura versus galphan one think includes kings indian defense yes interesting one also play kings indian black love model game alex saying like advantages kings indian one line like every higher rated player destroys kings indian see beautiful games like ah yes wan na play ideas one plays anymore get demolished play kings indian anymore ruin funner love hate relationship truly reality like higher level players everybody yeah studying openings know line white automatically get upper edge kind openings develop start players trying new lines see ones everybody adopts think best one yeah hikaru really known aggressive style play hikaru black yeah hikaru black playing kings indian see position white already lot huge center advantage hikaru gon na start even next move bringing pieces towards white king side plan start pushing pawns towards white king ignore attack goes queen side great example dream attack kings indian complete asymmetry towards king side left side board ton pieces yeah exactly wow moved knight like three times row yep need move knight order make space pawn counterintuitive stockfish like putting almost pieces back rank pushing king side pawns blocking dark squared bishop none makes sense mimicking awesome okay yeah see white going queen side attack black going king side attack keep going little bit wait starts pretty sacrifices fun analyze games person computer think yeah okay hikaru preparing attack really like game finds tactics necessarily computer would go hard face human lot people play king indian practice hard defend keep moving little bit forward okay yep white continuing king side plan like first piece think taken yep first trade begins exactly hikaru pause attack little bit make sure white two dire threats queen side cool see asymmetry thing exactly beautiful king indian one thing highlight rook move bizarre typically like computer probably like idea interesting major weakness black coming attack also making room bishop come backwards challenge like human like maneuver computers would like think computers would like though move regardless takes pawn rook would attack yeah well looked actually studied line right away best move cutting computer play actually said good question guys study games use mind also use computers build intuition like looking position like would computer try understand wants studying seriously would try use mind never gon na get exact position really need notice trends often computers give moves specific position certain tactic use computers check make sure make obvious blunder might missed computer tell like best move give kind explanation tell gives different valuations position like black half pawn something like hints towards right move figure could usually figure right away going moves like oh okay makes sense feel like computer take weird lines potentially like sacrifice like hell sacrificing well get pretty sacrifice soon could keep playing little bit bonds pushed forward yeah hikaru kind ignoring queenside attack basically reply plan convert podcast viewers youtube yeah idea talking right zen experience listening imagining board imagine pieces ceiling yeah calling people freaking even supposed keep track position late many hard blindfold chess tried able keep board played blindfold chess pretty hard muscle trained much visual comes chess one top player starts becoming second nature actually talk magnus maybe influenced queen gambit actually visualize head magnus boring board right kind every chess player know like know chess like computer games kinds skins like yeah like fancy stuff anything fancy sadly like cool warrior mode basic default chess base board head cause yeah ca use brain power adding colors cause already keep track pieces one board time yes okay current position yeah bet every chess wonder get differently certain players really good even play blindfold chess play multiple games time would curious usually thinking one game one mind yeah operation move one piece like branch analysis like still somehow visualize branching process forget stuff maybe like constant memory recall something always looking one board time also oh cause also looking future yeah cause backtrack future guess keeping position memory remembering pieces playing one board come back initial one started kind keep brain also easier come back played position feel like memory recall gets blunder like see attacked certain things get exhausted thinking different thing forget actually forget entire branch things supposed worried happens often yeah spend bunch time calculating position let say like really trouble spending minutes calculating forget something spotted like oh two three moves walk trap cause looked many lines play see like oh looked saw forgot yeah often called tunneling looking deeply one thing forget rest board worst least beginner level like know bishop sitting obviously attacking like queen something forget bishop exists yep cause sit moves move forget existence yeah definitely embarrassing well happens everyone yes okay cool okay see trades happening queen side go otherwise trouble game oh sorry gets exciting yeah nine h four really sacrifice starts two important pawns ones front king cause helping entire defense car actually preparing sacrifice night pawn continue attack open position black get kind attack completely lost queen side also pushed king side pawns going danger one die moments oh okay makes cause king wide open yeah yeah king wide open white pieces pointed towards queen side also cramped attack primarily black done two pawns night light squared bishop always extremely important want trade kings indian helpful lot attacks even though side board guess go way across like sure probably threatening like example another move black could played would something like bishop h three take bishop actually get mated g two let say take could push pawn would checkmate kind using bishop sacrifice white kings side pawns yeah freaking bishop exactly right thing position looks scary white black pawns starting come towards one things humans start worry positions whereas computers obviously calculate best line maybe attack go saying computer might say white actually slight favorite yeah possible okay white makes little bit room moving rook attack begins like commentary knight knight hugging king actually white ca even take king h four h three coming white ca take knight yeah oh say king yes thank knight ca take knight white takes knight black starts pushing pawn h four h three incoming idea trying defend looks difficult white chooses cool watch chess game experience watching without understanding day feel like could use make better content true okay mean getting drunk unfortunately chess players never leaves yeah matter actually cute move black queen attack king cramped ca actually take going get checkmated pawn sad way go truly yeah pawns lot work really king indian king indian player attack king side pawns yeah pawns like right ones lot threatening right also opening position bring pieces pawns kind help break open king side ca checkmate pawns come need start bringing pieces well see hikaru okay go puts sacrifice actually another beautiful sacrifice game puts king check pawn right pawn going given free idea giving piece want space open king always trying king side trying remove many king defenders without giving much pieces ton pieces king side black waiting harm exactly notice every single move white getting attacked like never getting break black keeps throwing pieces funny black queen hanging like three moves white still ca anything yeah rook puts king check yep king runs leave queen hanging develop piece slight squared bishop important threatening checkmate bishop coming game queen hanging mean game beautiful amount calculation hikaru put position feels like much danger right interesting knight takes pawns queen attacked twice care takes bishop still threatening checkmate queen takes bishop yep defending g black goes grabs material back black already winning well ends winning knight black much defensive taking pieces yeah mean point two whole pieces knew would knight yeah exactly queen queen take rook takes much attack king anymore hikaru knight gg yeah correct way saying cause played demis asabas played chess quickly realized like facial expressions like stopped playing oh like already set yeah like good time like give right going get checkmate like could see like checkmate like five seven moves away something play usually resign position chess etiquette resign position opponent definitely going win respect like piece obviously top grandmasters people kids cause coaches always tell never resign hopelessly lost positions playing like two rooks king soul king still playing position obvious ca win cause kids might make errors yeah might well interesting thing think game six previous world championship magnus one beat nep yeah first time beat like said know often come across kind situation said engines predict draw yeah mean going draw play hoping take person mean guess end game thing take deep water make positional mistake something know like gut knows supposed draw still plays yeah mean one could theoretically draw could hard defend cause hard technique know human especially game know nepo also time pressure makes even harder situations like always continue engine would give something like plus something clearly win anybody would know win usually supposed resign find beautiful game attacking chess asymmetry asymmetry fact dream king indian able get beautiful attack also two really nice sacrifices black continuously kept putting pressure white king point able win material best part attack work black would completely lost often happen way like attacking player often put position like screwed unless works online chess usually sacrifice know either gon na work lost fun positions play usually tournaments sacrifice playing confidence taking time calculate yeah three minutes time take whim follow intuition find later confident work calculated way end calculated point enough exchange sack think could play position train chess days practice deliberate practice mean tough position also creator educator entertainer try put time like daily practice train chess anymore focusing creating preparing tournament back day would train tournament seriously tournaments way would work opening preparation specific tournament really need lines memorized could also prepare specific opponents would tactics make sure stay sharp two things would every single day tournament mix rest like maybe end games maybe positional chess tactics preparation looks like like puzzle like random puzzle thing yeah would train puzzles least like minutes books sometimes different kinds puzzles one could train pattern recognition supposed go quickly playing game mind tired still keeping track things little bit easily practicing combination sometimes take like minutes find calculate lot like making sure trained muscle andrea actually good finding ways balance still study also content yeah able hard thing getting irritated content competitive like playing chess losing talking entertaining gon na losing games winning started training streams bring coach one things wanted add alex training repertoire would daily puzzles every time streaming helped lot even like thing called puzzle rush three minutes puzzle puzzle get incrementally harder really good way build pattern recognition especially rusty would till hit high score would play blitz hit score want kind like fun part chess studying important one actually analyzing losses tournament games first sit look mistake try see find better moves would check computer see right game analysis also important try remember give shout listened couple episodes perpetual chess podcast pretty good whatever listened remember per think really focus teaching people train yeah play train kind stuff like yeah looking adult improver basically regular noobs get better chess one things one person said think grandmaster said maximize amount time spend every day like basically saying like suffering like like thinking calculating opposite magnus said like lot time matter puzzle whatever hell like difficult calculation get better yeah really depends training cause used think depends weaker cause really difficult puzzles training like visualization calculating moves ahead typically would maybe would get often regular game typically run like three four tactics actually easier fun ones solve really depends top hobbyist motivation different playing young age pretty high competitive ambition lot people new chess could basically work anything still improve focusing something like probably gon na stick consistent think helpful embarrassing loss career many flashbacks glad question andrea like specified know funny know cause mean said competitive like yeah could tell even way said like hate losing yeah mean reason hated chess high school cause always like okay many traumatizing losses like top three running first throw game hurt ego much always kids high school girl younger boys really cocky win start rubbing face yawning looking around like game destroying one tiny mistake ego huge never forget playing like chess scholarship tiebreaker first think lost year old girl could even use scholarship beat one first place got prize yeah losing little girl literally like makes sense right keep telling think think kaspar feeling playing year old magnus like much beauty sport age brilliant demographic anything feel like adults paired kid hard let get depends maybe really sweet kid times play kids really arrogant think intentionally kids mean certain etiquette thing like say yawning general like fact kids etiquette yeah yeah care yeah kids traumatized playing vegas even opponent board next kid least years old max playing adult takes hand starts fake phone kid studying sitting across diagonally picks banana starts talking like phone mouthing words two adult opponents thinking intensely game see adult look look kid making banana phone discerning eyes sighs yeah even

breaking core beliefs think like young kids look actually hear someone challenging could actually helpful people time lot bad publicity people see podcast see wow like know know interviewing listen see think reason also afraid society ca discourse people disagree even though like andrew tate think fact got banned platforms kind scary sets precedent always ask would ethical side even things president like trump even let say somebody left would happened leftist president would feel would think morally ethical something think important try find ways conversations reach mutual understanding try instead amplifying worst every human well one major reasons struggling really enjoy talking brilliant women think also lot women reached saying like inspired female guest talk somebody like andrew tate even really hard hitting think could good conversation lessens likelihood brilliant powerful female go show never watch thing society put labels well lex person platforms misogynists thing joe rogan got trouble controversy earlier year joe good friend mine said stand joe racist something like within certain communities somebody apologist racists right racist kind thing put labels without ever listening content without ever sort actually even simple step seems difficult like taking best possible interpretation person said giving benefit doubt empathy another person play field people assign labels difficult ultimately believe hope good conversations way like greater understanding people grow together society improve learn lessons mistakes past also play game people like putting labels canceling guy said one thing nice donald trump must far right nazi opposite person said something nice vaccine must far left whatever apologist whatever fauci us think ultimately middle weird

mentioned end game know hell end game mean rating know finish pieces board could rating yeah self end game tough humor tuned end games hard man tough difficult yeah ca reason magnus best seven hours game everybody given still squeezing juice fruit way would describe good source information within first moves generally tell tell well played opening well knew supposed memorize supposed play react piece interactions faced move advanced player would deal swiftly kind natural response gives information move king check massive giveaway people think oh check move king okay like direct response play danger like moving multiple pieces time meaning like moving pieces tied together interesting ways okay okay like like opening tell also lot people memorize openings right yeah takes two tango could memorize bunch stuff rating fluctuating place podcast feel memorize things gon na play crap ca play way memorized respond certain ways either respond way think supposed respond probably incorrect figure deal fresh position also reflect cases yeah yeah yeah wonder actually know current rating top rating top know current elo like board peak oh cool play like player like force yeah like given guessed lot elo ratings kind emulate kind interesting question yeah yeah course youtube twitch teaching kids play rating also play sometimes even behave explain things way kid could understand absolutely yeah think contributed growth channel frankly kind understood beginners thought game yeah taught people chess coach people many years guess new york yeah new york yeah learn way people learn like people successful getting good chess quickly commonalities patterns saw obsession yeah obsession look like would say obsession also love game bored wan na watch show wan na boot leechess get flamed anyone audience play saying leechess people ones would attack aggressively kind people probably chess people oh another know thought chess part well yes joke cult tribe whatever terms wan na use sure even places play live always places play live chess like omelette chess dominated well chess rough live interface course good courses everything yeah got got even good people whatever yes quote go okay like obsession means way look board bored quickly return chess board kind stuff like many hours day want spend yes spend want spend kids definitely talent course eternal debate talent versus hard work necessarily know talent chess specifically talent sure sort spatial visualization mind start picking squares controlled pieces opponent pieces faster memory much stronger learn openings like discussed learn literal patterns oh remember two tournaments ago remember game played yesterday keep playing playing playing think one commonality think seen kids obsession play lot seen kids brilliant kids like give page tactics puzzles solve faster anybody pick things super fast pleasure teach go tournament disaster ca handle anxiousness ca handle silent war another ca even handle also trash talk one sentence kid throw prize student seen kids totally disintegrate seen also students bully kids corn student strong verbal warfare allowed goes unnoticed even verbal warfare going like hmm little facial expressions would make board hey even think pretty creepy intensity creepy right word intensity silence board probably hear stuff like super quiet like library tension builds hear breathing highest level sides involved battle foresee time scary part see exact thing rare play move see miss evaluated saw move could played missed something three four moves deeper play move suddenly excited nervous sudden make accuracy tide shifts could totally different planes throughout game could plane throughout game really fascinating yeah thought see move seems suboptimal start think start try make sense miscalculate miscalculate magnus really good taking people away making suboptimal moves take away known openings unfair say yeah gets part really dominant reputation think letting people get ultra theoretical positions tournament online tournament said young player strategy anti sorry anti young player strategy mean means move seven eight go database games kid swim deal strategic complexities position gets might get enormous database within brain historical games similar structures sheer genius like wo know mix two sure younger ca remember game played bar soviet union read book magazine remembers remembers remembers structure fair crazy right think makes sort link think makes good think memory think seems get game better anybody else best way describe sports reaction time strength also evolving stamina games put two rated players world top players would drawn game game would ended game nobody would put magnus one aggressors game suddenly chance victory doubles weird game six nepo stockfish say supposed draw mean draw sometimes times means joke always make means stockfish smoke break ca explain joke explain yes stockfish show evaluation determines whether position equal slightly better one side slightly better side completely winning minus within balance say okay black little sprinkle activity something white could literally dead draw meaning theoretically impossible win oftentimes means smoke break joke stockfish know much complexity within position combinations different moves acceptable okay evaluate correctly wow even end games tough stockfish magnus game practical value remaining dead draw continued ask questions course six seven hours would sacrifice pawn would sacrifice another pawn damage structure evaluation stayed machine could stop one favorite game ruined whole day way destroyed made many plans day completely ruined day worthy recap watched whole game watched whole game world championship crazy time wanted first recap video also wanted best recap video spent hours games watching live broadcasts getting information variations trying put recap lot fun huge adrenaline dump people know recent world championship mean draw draw draw draw yeah kind boring way maybe draws like parts within draw like studying carefully yes average viewer truth especially game exciting magnus plays strange move move nine ever played jan try exploit fails attack builds shuffle pieces three hours favorite thing commentator like know wonder yeah commentators confused person spectator like interesting interesting part listening commentators guess might grandmasters yeah trying guess like nepo like magnus tried figure idea thinking cool interesting part game seemed yeah sure gon na keep draw especially situation seems almost remarkable magnus able pull win game six least magnus said ends nepo gon na take risks opens pure chess steve prefontaine said like whenever race like pure guts win also conversation jan first half second half tournament first half brilliant fire could even say playing magnus entire conversation match jan slows first sign loss setback match might fall apart worst way lose literally worse way got worse mean one move mistakes back jan candidates gon na play world championship got got slang terminology like somehow edit sophisticated british accent type phraseology okay think win match think know totally know close close okay make cases could say ding could say jan say world championship stage knows like training camp forth playing style also say ding liran one stable unemotional chess players ding oftentimes goes candidates lost jan first game round tournament got demolished first game sure suffering jet lag flight came spain like two days games began crazy got second place end chances finishing top two like first round game people wrote completely go top goes opposite way loses might come back truth know truth gon na interesting match also disappointing gon na get magnus yeah think stepping away world championship romantic world championships romantic anything think ca imagine would went dark quickly think sophisticated enough romantic think taught chess make youtube videos qualified subject romanticism think beautiful game chess think beautiful game go got yeah considered romantic yeah seeing beauty like bach seeing math music see beauty magic think see beauty certain types chess sure chess partially romantic romantic yeah yeah feel magnus stepping away world championships disappointing understandable steal magnus case understandable think prestigious could think world championships yeah yeah magnus still sign everything world champion good point put statement say everywhere else really yeah like world champion right world champion know world champion world chess champion maybe thinks journey top maintain status quo lost appeal know example like make big fan ufc never really seen exception george pierre walking khabib khabib kind different story walking away belt absolute zenith career also ufc champions extremely well taken care champions best lives course argue champions say lower weight divisions yes saying lot get sponsors get massive massive paydays international celebrities think chess fact world championship chess prize fund changed much like years could probably make money youtube yes playing randos randos fun playing challenging really challenging games playing super grandmasters like ad hoc events maybe little bit organized events world championship yeah still lot fun make lot money get everybody excited kind stuff yeah magnus specifically using world champion tally wins every tournament plays course year really even crazy estimate really seems sometimes yeah know much money tallied dedicated entire year managed social media various things growing brands getting sponsor deals think would make five times world champion crazy yeah money everything know totally fair people dedicate whole life winning olympics olympics funny interesting one even watch olympics carefully usually year yeah neither really strange sure covid sure weird know losing magic part also people olympics way distribute make little bit difficult watch like opinion available youtube easily accessible like difference like spacex like even nasa spacex better streaming launches commentating made nasa better well like ability sounds ridiculous making frictionless people watch get excited share kind stuff yeah like exactly sure magic like balances classy traditional world championships kind dramatic exciting streamer world feels like world championships relevant find balance yeah well recent one pretty good commentating yeah even necessarily talking lot worst part well every amazing yeah appreciate lot big arms race every major chess platform tried get one super grand master vishwanathan anand fabiano caruana name basically involved go back point yeah big question money magnus motivated money prize fund next world championship million would play says must something else must matter something worth worth got ta take word word like much stress low sample play yeah like wan na play many times yeah wants play wants make interesting yeah exactly yeah shorter games like increase possibility pure chess whatever heck means ca go back first karpov kasparov match stop due health concerns mean guy went five nil first six wins draws count draws amass total score best system happened match went something like seven eight months kasparov started making comeback five nothing five three called called said players poor health conditions kasparov stormed yelled farce match games long even maybe made video even remember many games long imagine bobby fischer wanted something almost extreme draws count first one wins nine nine world champion retains title beat world champion eight way like grueling know maybe like youtube recaps like players like general public three four hours right imagine favorite tennis match six months long yeah yeah still magic world championship wish could make interesting make work somehow think magnus really challenging fide everybody else step try figure great ultimately would say greatest time make case mentioned kasparov make case kasparov make case magnus carlsen bobby fischer tall opinion make case magnus gary bobby fischer one folks like mean capa blanca brilliant argue steinitz brilliant think probably kasparov magnus chance overtake longevity really important thinking yes think think magnus close extremely close would magic got ta get sixth one kidding world championships matter kind like basketball right rings comes many rings person win well basketball number years number one right like rating sorry like magnus really likes like nice system rating ranked number one championships low sampled tournaments general game game game helps estimate accurately elo rating yeah world number one think years right still less gary world number one years yeah quite wild still lower rating think magnus right yeah think rating general sort allegedly got inflated yeah true true think ca speak exactly happened also happens online go back three four years think best blitz players let say think sort happens exactly know mention strange change exactly sure year fide board chess age years old one two okay rating change factor three four times higher imagine means magnus rating change factor let say one rating change factor also one anybody rating rating change factor rating change factor win yeah formula basically let say base level five point change rating change factor one beat somebody gain five points kids rating change factor four ratings going four times higher four times compared normal folks one teenager us particular one month played bunch tournaments rating change factor became nearly rated top world random teenager united states became grandmaster ultimately bled like points rating inflated k exists mean many kids nowhere one good month like interesting like similar like tiktok inflates virality early well yeah know well least rumor like want get engaged thought even artificial likes want get dopamine addiction maybe want throw really passionate chess want throw sharks artificially inflating inflating rating maybe gets game much intensely maybe wonder many like backdoor meetings cigars factors determined elo rating changes stuff yeah knows probably lee chess anarchists yeah exactly think wan na stay away stuff guy named hans nieman yep beat magnus carlsen recently yeah already august september th oh

people different perspectives nuanced ways war full hate full love like hate love country love family tradition beautiful mix walk like carry ideas head empathize deeply listen people live elsewhere live india different perspective lot people india different perspective people ukraine know bleed thoughts express publicly like people judge harshly first human psychologically difficult also makes less willing fragile still try strong enough fragile front camera say things mind even know going create people going ruthlessly negative towards try wear heart sleeve still try fragile harder gon na

anywhere close oh mind like immediately attracted pulling thread like would fuck system yeah mind stops ha would really sophisticated thing go brain every day thinks best way compartmentalize chess digestible format put content chess board chess cheating yeah think youtube think currently mind fully focused also working like book think yes built chess engines without understanding chess much like know anyone interested ai build kinds systems kinds stuff chess easy game like starts othello goes chess go great benchmark great place explore different ai algorithms search machine learning cheating like similar kind ideas well make board instead eight eight like change things cheating almost like expanding engineering challenge chess real world okay allow know cheating horrible everything stockfish ai engine human working together interesting ways forgets chess machine human working together expand capability human really fascinating like beautiful thing course purely chess game ruins game like thinking ai interact human ways frictionless like know like neuralink brain computer interfaces dream directly connecting human brain ai system problem case think human ai interacting together ai dominates human mechanism makes moves actually played may maybe need advice thought told wo friend mine said couple friends previous guests podcast definitely need know connect already chess arm built computer vision chess board able extract vision way optical character recognition extract board gon na build cheating system demonstrate reason thought interesting something

especially given dominant youtube defining sort creative energy whole civilization youth chess chess going chess box eric rosen question reddit chess box said hands messed yeah yeah training something regular also remembered never talked hikaru talk rosen hikaru chess boxing sense mcgregor like shit talk segment eric rosen actually close friend mine probably five happens chess streamer talked buying homes talked stayed place took wedding photos flew new york paid stuff could hang wife take photos sun park oh looks familiar yeah good friend mine terms chess boxing chess boxing really fascinating sport boxing also chess rounds start chess game clock segment lasts couple minutes put board away pause clock whatever time situation box minute keeps going know works terms time expiring meaning fighting judges tell fight going right know wins like win win knockout win checkmate clock run chessboard judges round limit go know mean yeah thought like rounds right thing russia big thing uk uk yeah know lot youtuber events boxing youtubers learn box box chess straight box like jake paul example ever gon na get jake paul yeah sure okay sure feel like many different guests mentioned jake paul would fun guest obviously biggest scorer legitimately boxing people yeah chess players never gon na learn box level us starting basically zero ludwig talked behind scenes say hey would feel chess boxing match said okay yeah maybe gon na said five months always wanted train combat weight lifted done cardio played basketball still ufc fan yeah admire fighting yeah would enjoy really bad lower back makes lot different combat difficult said know screw going contact local gyms one guy emailing back forth actually watched youtube videos first respond said yeah like come couple classes like see feel first conditioning killed fighting conditioning know kills completely different type conditioning felt good really wanted come back since july training three four days week nice feel pretty good love lower back feels good lower everything feels good whole body got stronger saying going fuck hikaru training fighting talked eric truth concerned head trauma actually sparred like sparring shadow boxing go personal training group class fighting fighting bag shadow boxing form improving punched get hit stomach get hit side kicks nobody punched face yet think adequately concerned ridiculous amount money table decided worth pursuing hikaru come picture possible competitor people ask time would fight people like andrea botes kick ass tough one ca going say going fight woman larger take l anytime woman mentioned fine like owen stinks winning one right exactly lost boteses anna rudolph anna kremling chess creators like hypothetically yeah get asked hypothetical fight yeah yeah okay training think yeah andrea training event got announced event hypothetically going main event eric rosen yeah announced kind like thought like maybe let knew declined fight eric would participating even knew know knew going main event kind offered guys hamilton oh still going chess boxing event happen december los angeles yeah nice main event hamilton also chess bra couple guys part chess bra channel lawrence trent lawrence trent international master england think done boxing little bit commentator brash guy nice controversial guy yeah funny cause started lawrence put videos went damn done yeah think mean right first many things say one want take seriously know pull like know train lot gon na affect rest life changes think taking combat sports seriously changes good negative costs think cause whole nother thing man like marathon running something really pulls thing head trauma like take kind stuff seriously especially sparring kind stuff still celebrities know pretty exciting right know fun watch hikaru like something well always said hikaru magnus boxing event event know would magnus said anything like chest boxing well first gon na commentate ludwig event said kind said oh people past level chess mine level chess wanted get physical think talking hikaru think anybody else good one man good one think magnus think one think magnus better physical shape also little bit bigger think hikaru longer reach think hikaru dog though think think think gon na gon na get like think gon na quit ring would think hikaru would go nuts beginning burn magnus survive feel like hikaru would go crazy get exhausted would able pace correctly maybe chasing first round knockout yeah yeah swing like crazy honestly love see like effect physical exertion game think sure strong enough yes think definitely underestimate effect punched maybe bleeding nose something like yeah joke ca ca say anticipating first day actually sparring get seriously hit know gon na feel good even take hard jab stomach ribs like man rough mean three minutes heavy bag finished like slacking form cause arms tired hit fingers instead knuckles hands like see red skin like completely pink meaty skin realize hitting today pain unbearable ca imagine head must mean gets different thing mean course skin gets tougher everything gets tougher gets used head weird one cause gon na send kinds signals gon na get skin type signals brain weird thing cause hurt yeah damage damage materialize manifest years later weird one die braveheart speech got ta ask bots cause like super interesting played lot bots different levels video called advanced chess bots terrifying difference playing humans bots like mentioned nelson bot brings queen think rated okay like style difference way bots play way humans play lot people prefer playing bots anxiety playing humans legitimate thing interesting lot beginners like live chess get nervous know anxiety get close highest ever rating panic happens yeah happens even play bots somehow reliable something yeah know big thing big thing popularity video shows people enjoy watching play chess bots gon na demystify might shocking bots bot part could program bot make mistakes certain moment could program bot spend less time certain moves gotten sophisticated enough basically program play whatever less level human plays say play level programmed throw mistakes problem beginners play bots bots programmed following way beginner bots like literal toddlers understanding whatsoever literally lose pieces wo lose pieces make mistakes way beginners beginners actually know start game struggle first eight moves nine moves mistakes different bots bot plays completely outlandish types mistakes pick terms pattern standpoint actual humans play like move queen opposite side board reason take yeah even blunder almost like randomness yeah completely random problem extends advanced bots play opening completely reasonably hang rook okay maybe happens exactly get strong level game know openings well start navigating middle game based already things remember basically one side chooses bad plan side chooses better plan one thing leads another nobody recreationally hangs pieces way bots kind programmed play bots video remember playing yeah nuts calculating every time thought trick two three second moment thought would play best move sometimes also happens gets dead loop starts bulldozing ca stop made mistakes already programmed make bulldozes rest way interesting mean played stockfish bunch got built bunch different chess experiments recently chess playing bot also built infinite chess board stockfish playing like infinite number chess games one parameters interesting play long gets think move affects rating thing oh little bit tricky one sure people know well trivial understand must good formula also interesting think controlled number blunders probably better controlled number blunders good way build bot training purposes least time per move probably better craziest thing couple devs helping build scaling courses better chess learning platform essentially done lot different experiments stockfish even happy get stockfish making moves millisecond plays better human disgusting disturbing frankly crazy like ca react car stopping front anywhere near fast yeah reason interested large chessboard tens thousands hundreds thousands game going time think minimum amount thinking per move allow seem damn good least eye basically lowest possible setting give yeah incredible incredible bots able far know primarily machine learning based stockfish stockfish moved machine learning completely search far know yeah lose bit move discovery evaluation changing way stockfish works discovering moves way looks forward evaluates positions changed matthew sadler wrote book game changer alpha zero alpha zero yeah yeah explains significantly better way think works make feel first saw alpha zero play excited sort existential thoughts enjoyed watching completely destroy openings people thought good experiment though caveat sense think alpha zero playing full tank servers think stockfish think one things people point playing since able demonstrate much less yeah also alpha zero stopped developing stopped developing yes sucks perspective deepmind perspective like right well took really tricky game something honestly incredible well mean without human supervision like without training human expert games self play mean learning like think child human child toddler learning know somewhat nothing becoming capable human think think intelligence fact able play become best player world game go kinds games incredible obviously inspired modern stockfish kind self play methods somebody reddit asked pretty interesting question know interesting answer makes chess move quote unquote human someone oh mentioning third person someone working ai idea humaneness would seem incredibly interesting yes sir especially since cheat detection relies humaneness way detect cheaters think since children born right advantage engine training whole life start see game way engine person considered cheater play like engine also seem discrepancy especially levy play appears move often says things like quote normal player normal quotes normal player would think cheating since magnus doubt magnus great humaneness benchmark elo rating moves start look like engine without critique bunch questions combine two quotes one one thing like say sometimes chess game moves look opening look ridiculous viewer played would make fun slap always job chess coach smack magnus plays oh wow different mixed quote another quote explaining something say oh engine says play like one opponents plays like report cheating fused two quotes said oh human ca play like engine move magnus playing mixed kind two things interesting levels humor insight yeah difference human move engine like engine move think two things number one computer move outlandish concept idea best example give gave hundred grandmasters position told think best move black position right nothing overwhelming amount would look position evaluate everything know game chess relatively similar obviously slightly imbalanced based skill level would come sample size two three moves comes computer fucking haymaker suddenly everybody goes oh everything know chess gone window start looking move know best move start adding evidence behind verdict opposed getting verdict well first looking evidence concept idea outlandish based certain type position ca fully grasp continue beg engine tell variation move good extension good way chess works like move good computer seen various branches things going forward also good bring back human could even conceptualized initial thing second thing computer moves look counterintuitive might position looks like demands position b computer like nope seen future way possibly could emotions like dumb moves brilliant moves look similar yes oftentimes actually back hans thing lot people dissecting games playing basically saying like even fabiano caruana one best players world podcast yesterday basically saying okay beyond level saying league league played world championship get read lines right possible hans level genius like different kinds genius like one could league kind thing maybe case magnus understanding end games somehow understands last phase game complexities problems pose better anybody else see magnus poor looking moves end game like moves fit gut says would optimal yes also even think right might even consider reliance information even computer going game six kept things kept playing kept finding play posing questions humans computers could understand beat engine basically would beaten engine would defended jan lost game move psychologically felt game contributed computer would defended time podcast comes know week something like feel like happen let see predicting engine hans drama end saga like let look three months time get next world championship let say options possible let imagine let say like probabilities options forced agrees whatever come huge amount evidence cheating past hans comes hans uncomfortable general make sure maybe update little bit attack lot attack cheater right without evidence without clear conclusive evidence physical evidence physical evidence right tricky thing yeah like stuff talking beyond level starts kind intuitive circumstantial evidence statistical evidence behind board games played games match called engine correlation magnus many top grandmasters combined argued strong playing weaker opposition always kind argument statistics fact guy magnus name dropped maxime blugi blugi chess grandmaster even think president us chess federation played blitz games turns even fully aware extent banned cheating cheating actually hans actually worked yes name dropped right also good see getting still physical proof smoke know ends know denies death ends filing sort legal action sort ethics complaint admits everything know well matter hope despite chess mentally strong enough whatever reason whatever come keep saying ca imagine like really ca imagine maybe much compassion think really feel like end day chess game game played millions people throughout history nations basically fought wars chess board like lot like olympics olympics little dude running hockey thing puck know also much also nations sort figuring conflict way involve violence yeah serious thing thing inspires millions people testing ground intelligent systems eventually take human civilization yeah know yeah mean bots really interesting know lessons like played clone watched stockfish versus stockfish video people check lot awesome videos video titled stockfish versus stockfish experiment made play made play learn experiment enjoyed first always make draw engines get play beginning position always draw especially engine stockfish stockfish think one side ever beat basically program play certain opening position according chess theory get see interesting ways evaluate one things one ways played london opening absurd like completely ridiculous black sacrificed two pawns early move six borderline completely lost position sides foresaw way white gon na able use material advantage give back stabilize position like black got crazy attack jesus christ crazy drew end drawing also gon na make play either bad openings like popular gambits looking something like way gon na basically say chess gambits best way gon na theoretically engine able beat gambit gambit rarely blessed computer computer beat gambit means good means losing completely lost gambit beat draws despite getting early disadvantage means gambit reliable play good way evaluate opening games yeah best favorite opening openings like opening got back chess quit like three years went friend house book lars skandorf danish grandmaster called karakhan defense want white want black wan na show opening opening karakhan defense play e play play black yeah develop put counts opening okay development development matter yeah development goes variations karakhan karakhan like city neighborhoods okay yeah two pawns center called breyer variation good thing two squares yeah put two pawns center yeah good thing yes go decide gon na center pawn push take defend push take defend right yeah would suggest take worst take stable trade pushing considered best advancing taking space away think alpha zero stockfish would probably always push push something called like main line sideline main line popular played levels moving bishop played lot beginners intermediate players love opening much move three black already plus score crazy supposed happen tricky second popular move undermining center trying get take free pawn destabilize leave kinda hanging plus score susceptible destabilization yes people rating ladder understand deal coming basically know deal structural attack would stockfish try defend pawn keep structure would take pawn tell go fuck oh knew cause right would take pawn like right win back even would suffer would make win back annoying way would make tie shoes together block like stockfish would yes best move best move rating ladder funny interesting bo like play play gms play move bishop different ways evolves like rest matter like pawn structure thing yeah mean steepest openings anywhere like two moves like moves kind thing yeah theory quickly two move two move three like basically general idea remember games mean know karokan games start finish played since know different branches goes yeah think know every opening chess basically think title players know every opening know ca play competitively would weirder openings like slightly suboptimal might explored like magnus might play fuck opponent played something recently actually german prodigy vincent keimer specific move order popular opening basically position reached thousands times move order magnus chose white played maybe time crazy thousands games supposed good meaning allows black equalize black going winning game equalizing go second magnus says care equalizing want position want opponent know answers test interesting cause also fucks psychologically throws always keep toes weird position also advantage able intimidate wonder many people much role like scared person huge role think think top guys would deny know seventh hour playing magnus different feeling magnus messing around opening different another person messing around opening kind like expect something see translates poker think gets little bit maybe less respect poker world chess world sort alpha gets lot respect talked daniel negrano gets person respect magnus carlsen honestly either chess poker magnus carlsen gon na say hans niemann true like magnus hilarious mean talks rating like pretty good talks good poker suck know think view think honestly believes degree probably part engine fuels get better better better better yeah well saying magnus chess board poker table kind keep eye maybe mysterious guy chess different like man yeah people yeah poker talk phil ivey way yeah yeah yeah like super intimidating think probably harder intimidate poker actually know know something intimidating excellence deterministic game terrifying like fucked mean like playing stockfish like fucked thing suffocate especially makes moves understand beautiful thing honestly sacrifices engines fuck like could sacrifice pieces get back get back could look even get back position bad gave full material nothing yeah terrifying yeah terrifying like transfers ai systems general like system plays weak fool people trying get better chess beginners stage development advice would give getting better except watch channel yeah course watch videos check gon na scale courses serious note prepared lose game lose game prepared lose game prepared lose way win mom gave advice maybe discovered liked girls said gon na get lot nos life yeses even happened wife actually whole journey quite fascinating paved rejection paved yes various ghostings course years got married love much wonderful tale chess gon na lose lot adults noticed kids adults learn chess differently kids yell class excited realize many times get something wrong adults never wan na talk lessons afraid wrong adults preface correct answers probably wrong shut paying private lesson place wrong adults especially think dominant career dedicated lot brain power lot work ethic lot study time gon na translate chess kids helicopter kids try apply lot stuff studying chess different studying anything else anything else could argued martial arts guess yeah beginner mind actually means sucking every aspect game studying interesting ways suck realize get better without actually trying get better show boxing gym one day move hips better shadow boxing sensei goes moving feet better today got better like practice footwork brain starts putting together randomly might study shitload still lose points gon na study chess owen fuck sake activity people go going much work grandmaster nowhere else life ever seen someone try pick hobby wan na top ranking level chess right example like grappling sports see people come gym basically ask long get ufc right ufc champion different mean grandmaster equivalent getting ufc guess yeah people quickly realize like pound girl taps pound like ripped dude realize like okay art journey think resist lessons failure teaches grow like relax one things learn probably applies chess know relax body mind like something like said like resist relax body mind learn way game probably add put lot hours fun perpetual chess podcast listened somebody say like like puzzles none matters number hours spend kind suffering meaning like thinking deeply like straining like thinking mind like really working hard magnus says matters number hours spend fun yeah mix mix right quite agree suffering think people lot fake learning play speed games go tactics okay tactics okay boop wrong next one used tell students need puzzles need get correct care long takes suppose kind like suffering theory puzzles get eight correct even laughable correct amount know ca get things right way requires like thinking deeply like really struggling like especially puzzles level level done puzzle hour ago stubborn want put wrong answer yeah guy listening said like good maybe blindfold chess say like blindfold skills never practice visualize board quite well played played four games blindfolded time sucks feels horrible brain afterward like play four simultaneous games blindfolded yeah take know get asked time practice fuck would need good party trick yes video magnus columbus circle youtube like know many views live announcer ca imagine chaotic yeah great party trick yeah oh reddit thing forgot ask magnus asked ask moved wrong piece yes somehow remembered know happened tell kind presumed figured way person moving moved wrong piece yeah yeah forgot ask yeah forget mean memory sucks said know ups downs childhood little rough sometimes also get attacked beautiful

let leave words irving chernev every chess master beginner thank listening hope see next time', 'magnus played private game games blitz moscow hotel sounds feels legendary reason probably agreed play match oftentimes reference one biggest mistakes terms competitive chess made specifically gave magnus chance understand style chess magnus friends enemies frenemies status relationship yeah think rivalries chess everybody tries hype like everyone hates thing end day yes competitive wan na beat whether magnus top players also realize small world like lot us able make living playing game professionals alluded earlier top players make living even though competitive wan na beat certain level respect sort brotherhood would say us would say frenemies following conversation hikaru nakamura chess super grandmaster one greatest chess players world including currently ranked world number one blitz chess also one popular chess streamers twitch youtube definitely check channel name gmhikaru lex friedman podcast support please check sponsors description dear friends hikaru nakamura magnus played private game games blitz moscow hotel sounds feels legendary final score half half magnus find score actually curious think publicly said briefly said ever mentioned serious way think deep dive based links started subreddit great journeys start yeah kind crazy story remember quite well went dinner final night someone actually high within internet chess club time went nice dinner think like couple drinks maybe wine beer know think towards end dinner somehow got word relayed information magnus wanted play private match agreed play match probably actually nothing like state drinks anything nature reason probably agreed play match often times reference one biggest mistakes terms competitive chess made specifically gave magnus chance understand style chess time actually pretty good results magnus think maybe one two games many games pressing close winning prior match went played match things happened first magnus really started understand style played sorts different openings think understood times great opening many openings would play slightly dubious variations opposed main lines secondly standpoint problem realized since playing increment many games close winning would defend end games amazingly well would defend technically drawn end games would like extra pawn would like rook bishop versus rook knight say four pawns three pawns end games nature super chess might understand referring end games one side might extra material extra pawn say extra two pawns theoretically draw give example set pieces talking five six seven pieces like kind thing okay like basic one would rook four pawns rook three pawns would nine total pieces board four pawns one side three pawns side side board technical draw known probably let say years roughly give take theoretical draw matter position pawns pawns one side board like like let say four pawns right four pawns black three pawns pawns h g pawns board something like rooks draw matter next moves game know draw end game perfect play things like magnus actually saved want say like five six remember quite well think score close probably last like games match end started winning started winning spades lot situations like one game maybe two games match end game like able win end game match even much lost match margin lost fact realized hard beat even got advantage think magnus learned weakness openings remember actually remember game game played sicilian nydorf played variation bishop g move number six sure insert graphic later show sicilian type opening sicilian opening nydorf variation played bobby fischer former world champion gary kasparov well played sorts different openings course serious serious match serious gon na count ranking trying fill opponent strong versus weak one game remember clearly played bishop g variation nydorf think played e played knight bd e dubious best response one example playing things little bit dubious playing absolute main line moves theory trying get outside theory think magnus learned even though appeared well prepared openings quite level could different interpretation going outside main line willing experiment take risks chaotic actually strength weakness especially sitting hotel room late night past midnight playing chess mean interpret weakness magnus going forward able figure lines super precise deviate got punished opening many games like night opening variation specifically knew repertoire would pick lines play absolute best lines order equalize would much worse effective nevertheless pretty legendary two one best chess players world throughout whole period still today sat hotel room played ton chess like like mean think little little video sure mean like epic right video exist way think one journalist macaulay peterson able film parts room magnus think henrik think macaulay people go youtube watch chess digital strategies macaulay peterson channel people listening dimly lit room yellow light emerging darkness two faces guy mean deep focus time must probably like one morning believe day day final day final round occurred closing ceremonies playing afterwards mean able appreciate epicness many favorite memories actually similar another memory really recall fondly us championship called us chess championship held end believe la jolla san diego event event playing blitz probably like four five hours lobby hotel kind situation playing love game opposed anything else course nowadays think magnus playing dimly lit room like would almost certainly happen would probably certain stakes involved us play go back time sorts memories moments would happen time part regret happened think comes back general philosophy feel like everything happens reason one core beliefs like really look back mistakes feel like everything happened things transpired way reason look terms potentially like world championship aspirations think certainly big mistake competitive standpoint magnus figured weaknesses time exploited many many years fact think look match played meltwater tournament think june later like september played epic match finals tour went way seventh match magnus armageddon match openings much better able match openings worse opening games made huge difference many years able exploit openings mean score mean reason one reasons score lopsided way games mentioned seven games interesting look analyze ideas remember interesting mean whole actually sort set probably come play terms world championship format seven matches four games played four game match four games say two half one half win match number one like win four matches four games remember couple berlin games sixth match believe seventh match well magnus actually made mistakes critical games gon na explain basics berlin type opening rui lopez spanish opening actually existed way back sixties really became popular believe gary kasparov vladimir kramnik played world championship match kasparov world champion long time think close think years roughly maybe little bit lost match gary white pieces kasparov able effectively get advantage lot games quick draws chess want put pressure opponent white pieces kasparov able anything white pieces kramnik able beat colors reversed kramnik game grunfeld game one queens game declined slash nimzo variations well reason gary kasparov lost world championship title variation teach berlin opening absolutely opening starts let move microphone little bit starts e goes e knight f knight yeah five knight point standard like berlin yeah berlin starting position berlin defense white many many options interesting work gary certain point remember access database something like files berlin defense happened gary somebody way learned chess much like certain openings okay openings okay considered dubious time gary basically decided go end game castles knight takes pawn castling end game show knight takes pawn moves forced got pawn mean forced means like optimal things exactly moves think almost least black absolutely forced else end trouble said knight takes knight oh okay attacks bishop got white takes black takes back pawn front queen pawn takes pawn knight goes queen takes queen king takes queen aggressive yeah got position end game time got ruined normal conventions guess right hand kramnik quite brilliant gary known opening preparation getting advantage tactical aggressive player playing end game right start gary basically thought better white tried prove unable prove think maybe game nine game actually maybe order wrong think white even number games basically spent four five games white pieces trying win end game able win fact even come close proving advantage kept wasting white pieces match kramnik basically took advantage white pieces gary black pieces able win games nice style difference kind brilliant new problem presented match gary gut says white better white going push position gon na change anything match match going try find way better kind stubbornness think like way chess right mistake way gut says position better capitalize right think old school way thinking chess computers basically humans intuition calculation process really determined whether position better like gary time openings dubious dubious means somebody better learned computers even small advantages generally mean anything position defendable wo lose game play optimal moves even advantage like half pawn example like optimal play computer still prove position hold lose game gary learned like opening right like knows correct prove finally towards end match tried switch already way late time win white pieces come close one later games spent whole match trying prove berlin defense playable position computer would say black better would say white slightly better black moved king unable castle king kind open center board oh wait stockfish dandjen would agree gary intuition yes end day go like five moves deeper number sequences gon na go means draw yes correct bad thing white winning well wan na put pressure opponent white pieces tournament match got engine says means good job playing white correct putting pressure mean gon na win gon na lot draws game chess drawish tendencies wan na try normally general approach days computers try put pressure opponent white black try solid make draw general approach gary actually peak quite opposite gary trying win games black pieces well playing openings like sicilian night orph modern technology podcast recently also spoke computers good players memorize many lines nowadays trying take risks black pieces almost always backfires lucky might make draw never get winning chances risk reward standpoint play almost perfectly make draw never gon na winning chances old days generally might lose games gon na chances win well much one sided lot players try solid way c squared podcast correct yes yeah amazing podcast shout guys glad started thing seems good thing hope keep going good thing great interview podcast talked sicilian night orp aggressive opening problem white one choices first five six moves white choices wan na show sure example would set get knight f pawn pawn trade knight knight pawn knight orp bobby fischer really popularized run becoming world champion gary played probably last years career solid opening defense sorry interrupt interesting people listening white side couple knights black side black many options black play b develop bishop b pawn guards pawn also play setups like potentially g putting bishop okay bringing different things bringing also push pawn e push pawn many different setups flexible white one choice terms play many moves move mentioned bishop g magnus played also bishop e bishop also moves like h move mentioned also moves like h h rook g even moves like basically nine moves white play move white plays sort dictates direction game extremely precise black white plays something like bishop g sharp aggressive also play something like bishop e pawn e something like knight f goes positional direction advanced sort setups explaining basic level white one chooses type game aggressive sharp sides chances something positional black probably okay play best moves order equalize end worse okay always responding black situation correct different different variations like bishop different said bring bishop position position position like fundamentally different variations like wonder ai computational perspective like single step yeah well make even simpler put knight positional put knight square aggressive normally white going push pawn f either f f potentially pawn g later even based go changes whether positional game tactical game choices constantly making going standard basic positional going aggressive take actually give another example psychology plays big role candidates tournament played june past year madrid spain actually white pieces alireza farrouja rising junior originally iran representing france knew wanted aggressive games normally play silly knight chose play one tournament knew wanted sharp positions lose also win played intentionally played variation knew going unhappy wanted sharp exciting games playing something boring plays correctly going draw going happy actually something dubious wanted create tension wanted create chaos knew boring would frustrate would make mistakes exactly yes yes big role ultimate troll highest level chess yeah mentioned psychology taking us back magnus even magnus games reddit said spoken losing magnus hit confidence truth aspect match magnus figuring stuff hit confidence like important confidence level young like firing cylinders well problem problem everybody play magnus happens broader level play somebody matter playing somehow able save positions much worse almost miraculous ways way magnus done everybody done done aronian many times done kramnik everybody someone able save games really starts affect know times happens starts adding affects way hard overcome think every top player issue played magnus like five times seen things happen game happen anybody else psychologically becomes harder harder overcome think lot junior players long history affect far directly certainly match though playing magnus viewed completely differently games saving end games started thinking like guy superhuman ca really thoughts playing competitively back mind always think every top player issue way overcome cause know necessarily better magnus going forward felt started playing game classical chess pandemic played online tournaments seemed like every month came close beat one event think lost two others tour final playing feel superhuman felt like playing learning style better think weird thing playing us many games start playing us like games course year actually started feeling confident cause feel like compete whereas playing like three four times classical chess previous couple years great glimpses moments feel like gon na able win start playing games get opportunities even convert feel like chances play three four games might lose one draw three never opportunities feel negative going able beat necessarily win game win positionally something reason technically speaking matchup two holes able find mean answer think actually quite simple think psychological actually anything else feel like anything differently also making mistakes making think psychological part versus part weird think chess mental game capable beating magnus us bad scores think people underestimate much role plays played online events specifically felt like really nothing lose also ties everything else happened pandemic well felt like nothing lose felt like playing freely unlike say magnus better player somehow expect beat felt like making mistakes making previous years dig psychological preparation something mental preparation makes successful like lessons years learned works drink bunch whiskey night small hacks major ones approach game really hard sort way feel like two different people one person pandemic professional chess player solely earned income everything derived pandemic sort different person making income whole psychological profile completely different joke literally care phrase used sense means care obviously competitive want well lose game well tournament end world kind way felt pressure needing always perform high think pandemic would try anything think previous game part like say bad game go walk evening clear mind sorts things really hacks per se trying essentially memory loss literally care meme philosophy sense way basically yes want perform well going give lose game end world title autobiography know probably immortal happen die also tombstone charles bukowski try tombstone think emphasizes similar concept slightly different artistic domain well lot people different interpretations statement think means take things seriously yeah mean agree completely think look career prior pandemic put huge amounts pressure really wanted good could way earning living one thing difficult chess top maybe players world make living game make good living way diminishing chess problem secure get invitations absolute top tournaments prize funds anywhere maybe potentially half million dollars get invitations hard earn living go earning maybe year earning like unstable think really put lot pressure way affected good way good way part also financial pressure like able make money elsewhere makes free take risks play pure game chess yeah makes yeah exactly made took pressure kind trying play well really worry like lose game end maybe like psychological stuff tried sort mean period time like certain things along lines yeah became free think definitely chess one things also hard look periods seemed like played better improved one periods basically dropped college elo roughly top world first probably half part played little almost went vancouver living first time studying much period started playing actually improved quickly broke shortly thereafter nothing chess moved vancouver much exactly oh enjoying nature going outside hiking mountains like going kayaking things done many years glad asked imagining something else imagining like dark room drinking playing video games okay cool good interesting break dropping college taking break giving everything chess terms preparation maybe actually rewind back beginning said naturally talented chess player brother really fascinating would say reason able break become one best chess players world naturally talented chess player yeah think applies actually chess number sort basic games actually matter naturally talented get something try figure get wrong mean many games like funny game phone use example game called geometry dash like anything silly little game phone play tap goes people probably know played maybe hour randomly played one hour terrible kind forgot week came back saw phone like okay wrong good game spent probably hours following month playing nonstop get better anything pretty good game chess thing started like good wrong basically refused accept could good game start actually played couple months poorly parents stopped playing six months said playing brother quite good brother one top ranked players age group united states playing six months relented let play first tournament back actually four games playing kids first three games really good lost form checkmate fourth game course quite ironic oh guess old time would eight years old seven eight eight year old future top ranked chess player great know somebody lost checkmate possible lose checkmate remember came quite well mean time know checkmate exists mean think probably knew existed playing like completely different world kid goes computer immediately figure basic checkmates different things time really exist find book yeah basic blunder yeah exactly cool yeah like came back good start lose like stuck improved quickly thereafter yeah straightforward secret fast improvement said said like first important step saying like wrong like figure wrong actually take step figuring wrong yeah think played much could like like consciously thinking eight year old really thinking sorts things big picture basically kept playing much could whether online whether brother reading chess books much could devoured much information could studying chess books studying chess books mean studying cover cover though like would study certain diagrams certain positions openings stuff like mostly tactics actually openings top level chess openings thing probably want say players maybe master level serious way maybe like early people know chess kind tactical ideas interesting basic understand understand take early leaps improvement yeah things like forks example attack two piece time discovered attacks like checkmates winning like queen material probably two important ones batteries batteries pens things nature many rich world way discovered attacks move piece put king check win like rook example material forking pieces attacking two pieces obviously person ca move two pieces time gon na lose one okay big world universe forks discovered attacks like know know like knights attacking like forks attacking like queen rook example like pawn attacking queen rook like rook bishop innumerable mean say think chess patterns see quicker catch improve think learning basic tactical themes beginner levels discovering patterns looking chess board looking like higher dimensional representation relative position pieces know basically something disjoint particular absolute position piece like seeing patterns like kind pattern elsewhere board like thinking patterns like absolute positions pieces think higher levels always thinking like thinking patterns one side board specifically also happens play strong player able remember say pawn structures pawns certain squares games played like years ago even potentially mix think lot subconscious actively thinking like figuring like thing definitely frequently play trying look pieces placed optimal squares better squares get past like using basic logic start think okay pure calculations like moves make lot sense start calculating direct moves one basic things think lot people actually looking piece placement trying figure pieces look like good squares versus bad squares piece asking question happy place like optimally happy place think important like look position board right good example happy place board right think sides actually pretty happy right thing playing black piece move sticks like follow basic principles basic principles probably bring bishop castle king castle king right exactly correct best way play position though way vibrating device inside right knew rating believe stockfish anyway higher like actually think using earlier version stockfish okay anyway sorry saying like basic move bishop castle king well let say bishop b play castle okay done everything piece king side would next set next way try develop pieces everything pretty strong except maybe pawn know okay think pieces pieces mean everything except pawns except pawns okay probably either bishop knight right side yeah correct wan na bring bishop knight let say go bishop e yeah yeah castle move knight either square somewhat irrelevant move knight play knight random move bringing bishop moved rook center okay oh well yeah unhappy place right okay let move queen follow basic principles okay wan na bring rooks center board yes like position pretty much developed pieces two pieces brought game queen rook rook consider game would say game really great square rook right position would probably move rook c middle game begins got gotten piece optimal squares look specific plan gotten pieces developed opening like basic thing think lot people think like optimal placements pieces constantly thinking pieces optimal placement kind tactics stuff like basic thing people follow actually pure calculations like moving five moves head realistic trying use basic logic figure pieces squares look correct something anybody looking person pieces thinking optimal placement like see bunch pieces optimal placement opponent tell mean higher level concept course like trying give beginner example something think well like try think opponent pieces like basic logic think lot people days upper levels chess look game something pure calculation lose human element trying calculate different sequences moves think basics something interesting see happens next generation kids become strong really approach game learn computers whereas like learned computers certain point start computers human element still exists game actually magnus think said use computer think maybe like years old something around human element game think newer generation wo mean gon na better us gon na completely different approach mean human elements basic logic versus raw calculation like anybody use computer time start game use computer look evaluations game see really ever moments opponent one thing great old days computers simply became strong would actually analysis opponent game much two humans analyzing game opponent two peers come human ideas automatically run back room look computer oh played move like winning game kind something longer exists game chess said reason analyze opponent game ideas engine tells ca reverse engineer logic makes sense start memorize good yes opening sure certain positions moves playable even give example actually night set position moves earlier knight b bishop c move king back center bishop back f pawn pawn front king push back two squares like example move nowadays humans play move pawn move years ago someone showed move kasparov would laugh matter would basically say idiot move like pushing pawn edge board nothing something playable even ask top grand master playable move makes sense would able say makes sense know fine computer says fine fine good fine probably like everything else equal perfect play definitely careful black worse sure ask ca say good move say okay maybe gon na expand king side push pawn push pawn forward maybe put bishop g positions pawn guards bishop ca give like actual good explanation move makes sense make sense fascinating young people today kids days probably move much nonchalantly see lot know safe least right know computer says fine grew without computers pushing pawn edge opening phase things like looks ridiculous course worked computers long enough know like know computers computers prove everything fine still feel wrong yeah well think computers get better also get better explaining currently basically able first simple language generation set chess moves language conversion explaining us dumb humans interesting tactical idea currently supposed figure like deep wisdom particular pawn coming kind way let ask ridiculous question think chess ever get solved opening position know optimal optimal level play highly doubt without major advances quantum computing think realistic expect chess hard solved think happen know could happen years maybe think near future realistic well let go pod head question suppose get solved opening think optimal well everything draw sure move one sure move one yes sure absolutely sure yes yes sure sure look computer games see decisive results played openings set generally ca ca move one play set openings like might play knight might play berlin defense normally set openings opposed opposed computers able whatever want believe general openings symmetrical like e e computers draw think optimal opening think e e knight f knight f probably guaranteed draw perfect perfect information know chess solved e e knight f knight f russian petrov defense optimal strategy sure see symmetrical play going lead draw constantly white maintain asymmetry constantly keep opponent balance yes e always symmetry chess inherently something mathematics game allows like thin line walk maintains end game asymmetry constantly move bring back balance game know think exists think basically saying e e think draw think draw c c think basically symmetry draw think draw even matter like saying solved openings draw yes think e c knight f sure draw openings sure first four possible starting moves think chess draw knight f response knight f probably knight f make simple play knight f move one black also play move one normally point white gon na end playing order probably gon na lead back yeah roads kind lead back well probably ways play think end day symmetry gon na lead like forced equality draw game chess demis asabas ceo deepmind deepmind helped create created alphazero says also chess player fan chess says reason hypothesis reason chess interesting game creative quote unquote tension bishop knight like many different dynamics created two pieces think truth mean poetry truth think definitely true look imbalances like crazy attacking positions like one thing bobby fischer really really good world champion playing end games bishop versus knight traditionally think knight better bishop even today end games fischer proved lot end games bishop better knight agree statement like imbalances like bishops knights many positions never really know like many positions knight better bishop knight bishop better two bishops like generally imbalances though bishops knights combinations two pieces lead interesting positions agree interesting positions fun like aspects find fun within game stuff around purity game think days see moves computer suggests game play go wow beauty moves would ever consider see move like might make couple moves try understand beauty seeing things like years ago never would even seen computers level today depth creativity saying even like language evaluation find lot beauty oh fun like computer source source creative fulfillment absolutely mean think also humbling well like spend whole life playing game got pretty good think pretty good even like even magnus think look see like things spent years playing game click see like really beautiful known aggressive player approach willing take big risks chessboard well think another thing aggressive player probably got elo kind style changed little bit think like play attacking chess loved playing openings like king indian sicilian night orph well little bit younger like try fight colors try fight every game win try hard one things get better better players also better better prepared diminishing returns play aggressive openings like king indian even dutch played takes far point people figure respond choices still play openings example played tournament louis three weeks ago played great king indian game jeffrey zhang american junior player still play start playing every game point lose games ca becomes much spoke podcast played night orph played fabiano caruana strong american player well blew board like four straight games like okay enough enough ca ca keep think prepared opening absolutely see opponent playing recently ideas going prepare ideas playing exactly yeah also fabiano night orph one opening poorly worked really hard came lot different ideas solved weakness role also known bit ego role ego chess helpful get way think mix think fine line think confident order get top know players expressive like like kasparov others people like anand express book think released fairly recently basically said like really angry room like banging walls something chairs remember exact story like able public kept like buttoned private think know edge edge get upset lose games lose games along way impossible get anywhere near top think every top player ego extreme confidence necessary never think get top probably almost field frankly believe best capacity best world yeah think think really ever thinking best world like going game game whoever playing believe beat know gon na beat better always whenever moment game knowing think also another thing start playing top tournaments kind lose sometimes positions opening strategies end positions drudge reach end games things nature also make jaded well quite long time times asshole someone regret chessboard beyond yeah asking internet questions yeah mean definitely true gon na pretend younger angry would lose games internet many stories specifically internet course think look back course wish able channel anger differently basically think simple gist would play blitz games online lost would get angry opponents instead getting angry course silly playing game trying win try beat think happy young teenager getting angry online games insulting lot people along way maybe paved way streaming career think feel like world attitude though really fueled younger feeling like world everyone hating hating world important able channel anger way really helped improve regret one hand yes course think wan na like hand gotten good different sure mix well ask empathize somebody else currently world attitude helping hans neumann several reasons world kind attitude well let ask chess controversy cheating covered people subscribe channel hilarious entertaining brilliant fun learn think stand hans ever cheated board chess things stand beginning october yeah tough question couple reasons think first people refer evidence regards whether hans cheated board think ever quote unquote hard evidence thing would ever constitute caught act literally caught using phone earpiece whatever might way would ever hard evidence stands right lot circumstantial evidence much legitimate remains seen know people questioned statistics people think convincing people think complete nonsense think right undecided feel within next three six months assuming hans able play board tournaments stats make clear one way based results whether legitimate think would say regardless whether believe cheated playing probably probably least matter regardless whether cheating already level high think stats bear next probably said three six months probably would say next six months whether something happened really know find compelling interesting kind analysis compare correlation engines humans try determine cheating done part initially thought actually quite legitimate found much recently anybody basically upload data whole theory seemed convincing time simply statistical evidence opinion games tournaments definitely considering rating look suspicious would say role like decide obviously gon na feed day whether think compelling evidence think would say intuitive standpoint world long time seen juniors risen ranks magnus many others always something stood like brilliant game played someone much higher rated seen players never really saw hans nieman difficult sort two eyes chess world long see things certain way like something never happened happening end day still possible completely possible hans something clicked certain age started improving spite fact know statistics look weird terms rating improvement know sort think six months probably able say one way certain confidence like know whether speaking statistics ask sure data scientist right good one course know thing see stats thrown try understand said also scary see things look legitimate disproven people say like cherry picking like dates things almost feels like come conclusion want think serious issue world chess going forward take seriously think point potential much much larger scandal agree like magnus think said existential threat chess like serious problem going get bigger basically spectator perspective competitor perspective sure trust results yeah think sure true think back last like five years plenty top level tournaments played security would go auditorium play games think big issue think big issue reason coming light features strong junior player close world elite many cheating scandals french player sebastian feller player igor roussos latvia think belarus maybe wrong maybe bulgaria borislav ivanov well three big cheating scandals absolute top levels chess think never became huge news story viewed kind way think organizers perhaps little bit lax terms security said possible hans fact kind bobby fischer level genius capable times genius chessboard oh absolutely absolutely possible think think everybody situation wan na see happens next six months think clear also interesting stats page report compiled essence say certain junior players basically peaked likely improve also gon na interesting look think like pages graphs graphs say junior players done look forward year two players improve also say something methods well used sort compile data yeah wonder junior players look data point look like practically like actual empirical data past year much improved particular thing like one thing kind tell ways need improve another actually look data face reality right think also could psychological effect thing makes whole han situation tough think cheated unsure going another psychological factor whenever play favor definitely favor definitely favor example go online play computer let say go play stockfish tomorrow gon na play certain type opening strategy try keep board closed maybe hope get lucky computers gotten good generally even even chance even strategies play differently normally would playing game move looks really weird seem logical also start affect immediately make mistake start questioning start thinking well going something unbecoming like start worrying happening tough situation agree magnus decision forfeit match recent match hans tough question heart hearts feel like better way handle magnus hand sort world top grandmasters heard rumors two years think fact blown treated seriously sure better option heart hearts feel like better way handle practicality like practical world think might made decision became big issue yeah mean guess would loved see certain cheating involved play bunch games yeah think actually article released today ken rogoff grandmaster chess wrote article boston globe essentially said like hans magnus play match see score cause statistically certain percentage means legitimate course security probably means level know real way settle necessarily also magnus ask play someone cheated think would never entertain idea cause like gon na play someone cheated know tough one thing would say topic really important note sort came left field people general public casual chess players something known even radar think said one things talk hans played better period time games broadcast versus broadcast actually heard rumor two years ago one terms playing specifically thing long time hard believe magnus could handled better two years rumors nothing done know people understand broadcast easier cheat removes one challenges cheating one way communication board engine engine watch broadcast signals right back mean really woken fact actually programmed setting silly sex toys aside bunch devices like size coin high resolution vibration send pocket basically smartphone ability vibrate programmatic communication anything bluetooth easiest like made wonder like wait minute often happen like every level play said became huge concern highest level play much cheating going middle level play especially money involved game poker really made think like future devices like much easier like engineer smaller smaller smaller devices onboard compute like future mean makes think probably kinds cyber security means defense get better even chess seems like security clumsy looking scanning recent tournament one thing see lot people talking whether hans cheater one thing almost nobody actually like trying show done everyone basically avoiding think single biggest reason simply done easily like weekend tournament play weekend tournament top prize hundred dollars players maybe master level somebody could already even louis security understanding junction device bought cost organizers weekend tournament local club spend device lot people talking think serious good even aside hans even important question debate present moment well think good talk right make defenses really step think could pretty cheap like security pretty cheaply take seriously right right course see happens think gon na end feed day anyone else try think asking organizers mean feel like feed day governing body end day figure gon na interesting see happens next couple months play hans opportunity arises well right near future think fortunately well maybe one tournament playing could playing potentially even set happening end year might like world blitz rapid chess championship think gon na make decision least six months challenge match one famous super grandmaster terms online makes sense terms chess going kind like serious controversy since like drama something like part existential threat game terms public perceives game story lingers chess full cheaters like never know cheating good game makes sense high profile person go head head think hans mean think would probably beat blitz rapid classical whole different question altogether think blitz rapid would mean one thing actually telling report also hans interview stuff said one thing say seemed adamant fact never cheated one thing say least according report truthful something possibly road consider wan na see happens everything else first fide whatever choose regards hans magnus see smoke stands think also one thing potentially dangerous whole situation convinced fide actually ultimate say top players feel cheated board even report says hans cheated top players still decide play sort override whatever ultimate decision fide comes also unclear know term us championship hans qualified playing tournament beyond turns automatically qualified also top players sort reach conclusion separate feeding flip part regrets chess community included implied hans cheated early think without evidence kind thing learn stick right kind divided chess community part like mean guess want empathize position empathize hans reputation essentially part whole destroyed point yes absolutely think comes specifics handled far go covering news makes difficult versus say content creators sense inside knowledge know probably also really public knowledge went louis play rapid blitz tournament louis cup happened magnus hans playing people told specifically thought cheating players event even gave like actual theories like things shoes things nature awkward spot well know mean like sure magnus dropped would come regardless though would come matter magnus gon na back stance hans others would brought anyways tough think wan na look blame think probably would ultimately ones probably could nipped bud much earlier stage would gotten got could released online cheating would think yeah think could released think also could probably let play happened second time well seems like happened like think like least like four five different times looked closely isolated incident think blame definitely stop people thinking like way influenced yeah biased supported part yes affect bias actually quite independent one thing interesting note lot people assumption like broadcasts tournaments things nature actively helping helping independent contractor opinions lists given like cheaters anything nature always completely separate compromising video forces follow main narrative release video publicly definitely yeah think look feel like people looking someone blame think actually magnus day think squarely handling sooner okay like magnus silent long periods time well know magnus still silent read situation sort nda information could release read magnus essentially saying thing said like ca say anything whatever whatnot releases perceive stuff could talk anyway magnus still saying anything really understand magnus said anything could illegal implications accusing somebody cheating board could like lawsuits want headaches wants focus game fun playing game get bogged lawyers kind yeah definitely possible magnus could also take route say well cheated online hundred games like gon na play cheater easy say factual proven go speculation board find little bit odd magnus said anything time also kind peculiar magnus reputation also kind tatters sense like lot people happy done still goes plays tournament european club cup tournament gaining like points though nothing happened mean really know magnus head like situation everyone coming making accusation think way would able play chess anywhere near level magnus playing whole situation yeah strange yeah wonder mind able play level forget let ask technical question cheating level like level high grand master level much information need technical question like terms morse code kinds things would need full information would need probably order make move let think simple representation would need two squares first designate piece second piece moving probably easiest smallest amount information need help basically like buzz critical position would buzz say would basically something like one buzz means position great two buzzes means position completely equal nothing special position oh know great yes tell tell intuition like many times played blitz online say something along lines feel like something like intuitively feel like good move probably winning something know time actually right like game look computer usually like oh played move would given big advantage would outright game know whether something good enough means worth calculate yes follow intuition probably normally gon na happen situation probably two moves three moves max gon na consider really critical position like feel like something two three moves know something able figure know position good okay one buzz good position current position next position need know whether like something really good position really good like equal position normal need know current position even future moves current position lot promise yes okay reverse like something bad saying trouble game situation trouble game probably little bit probably like would say two three times would need know source trouble yeah would need know yeah would need know like like one move good one move extrapolate well would useful know information position person could create lot trouble find like find like look magnus games lot situations position equal equal one move one move find one move significantly worse lot times case like somehow know like one move okay could figure yeah yeah one move significantly better rest mean could give like perfect example played game candidates tournament last round ding luoren china many times completely fine started drifting started making mistakes worse one last moment think one move would able draw game quite easily every move significantly worse find move lost game known would nice buzz right yes would known think greatest player time talked different angles magnus carlsen garry kasparov bobby fischer many others make case make case hicom mean ca make case serious know lot people want kind like give kind ego like obviously nowhere near conversation actually note would say also know people wanted know greatest player never played world championship become world champion think actually anywhere near top conversation actually think levon aronian tops conversation big margin simply number two world long time never even got match far world champions goat think magnus goat simply playing best chess bigger margin highest elo time hand chess game build upon build upon giants past learn definitely make case garry well mean number one player world plus years lot opening strategies came people still play today bobby sure really make case shot really quickly world champion short window time quit game soon became world champion really feel like put fisher conversation simply longevity couple years would say probably magnus understand people also say garry garry best player ever remains seen think magnus number one probably another let say another three four years think debate break makes good already talked different angles would also try get cause talked early hikaru like like talk first magnus makes magnus good various aspects game make good think magnus know end game end games get gon na blunder first thing know reach end game gon na make mistake obviously plays great openings really defined weakness weakness think specifically many many times players actually prepare opening phase soon think oftentimes make mistakes weakness magnus really weakness unlike say kasparov like kasparov hand clear weaknesses game like kramnik exploited first wan na say like ego right word like stubborn believing openings infallible could win could prove advantage win game opening like kramnik ultimately lost also generally great defender either strong tactically positions defensive would make mistakes lose end games like one games world championship kramnik clear defined weaknesses kasparov game whereas like magnus clearly defined weaknesses maybe like attacked maybe one thing likes king safety like attacked something easily whereas say someone tactical strong positionally something def happen quite frequently games steer games certain way mean always get something tangible whereas king safety something tangible hard attack someone based unless play certain style openings think garry kasparov reflecting comment would agree like relationship kramnik challenging mean think kramnik understood actually one thing funny speaking kasparov think got skin like worked kramnik actually played certain style aggressive sort risky opening play time working garry know annoyed garry like could kramnik play like think garry felt kramnik would blown board many great victories think kramnik understood garry worked together think late nineties think garry actually useful helpful terms kramnik getting spot one russian chess olympiad teams mid nineties think kramnik understood well garry could could figure think also another thing coming back psychological part kramnik actually beat kasparov many games kings indian defense kasparov played kings indian defense many years started losing like four five games row kramnik similar mentioned sicilian nydorf fabiano garry gave started switching playing grunfeld defense think also instilled psychological fear well garry boss openings one could compare makes good breakdown strengths weaknesses fikaro nakamura think probably biggest strength universal player play pretty much opening strategy really matter beyond think mainly really make many blunders make blunders unless lot pressure generally mean know oversimplifying simple apply blitz well think much applicable blitz particular intuition good making less blunders limited time clock opponents actually make lot blunders think much pronounced blitz classical chess blitz like seconds game players seconds intuition better mean magda maybe clear like look players say fabiano caruana strong player gets seconds situations almost always makes blunder almost always precise make less blunders really effect much dramatic blitz think intuition like sorry kind like almost philosophical question calculation kind weird memory recall like able short line prediction think playing many games online kind subconscious feel low time ca calculate look figure move wan na play calculation go think playing many games probably mean guessing played games online think playing games feel tangible way ca put really words feel say think currently number one ranked blitz player world unquestionably one greatest classical rapid blitz one best people many years world okay currently number one blitz love kinda dig secret success blitz saying intuition able time short make blunders make close optimal move think generally able keep games going matter low time always able like play game three minutes like games win quickly lot games top players players think use time final critical stages blunder blunder really end day really difference everybody strong sort like better brain better like cpu lack better way putting like makes split second decisions best think extremely good way almost nobody else really difference split second decisions cause get worse position keep game going players use time get final seconds almost always end winning situations visualizing like knows fast fast calculations basically look move see like like five seconds seconds play move make sure blunder look make sure blunder go first part fields like see move looks right know right ca put words looks like right move look like split second see long kind blunder play move bit tunnel vision able understand positions pieces board focusing specific interaction feel really feel like move feels right play stage game like long blunder feel way put feel like empirically result low probability blunder yeah like blunder even though could like forget like random piece like mean happen course rarely mean done stream many times like go move whatever reason like intuitively whether playing hundreds thousands games internet experience like intuitively feel like move right games played board online kinds variations game stands particularly one proud maybe hikaru immortal game strong candidate yes two games game boris gelfand offered queen sack think five consecutive moves sacrifice sacrifice queen yeah yes coming lingo take game one sequence late middle game funny cause actually think cause remember tried show game peter actually peter till confused move order late middle game wan na yeah yeah kind opening king indian defense knights bringing knight back wan na push pawn black pieces wan na push pawn pawns make room pawn yeah normally king indian try sort like storming pawns king side white king see push start pushing pawns forward happy position pawns diagonal like knights behind looks pretty nowadays well known standard theory time reason aware cause played tournament think montreal think montreal like year summer one friends actually played variation black pieces aware seemed dangerous black perspective yeah feel like hard white play yeah hard white play feels like getting attacked king see black pawns coming towards king hard defend also lot players like attacked generally try avoid positions king fire comes back said magnus well like like king fire therefore ca always get see white play long get point well white want something double edge complicated could avoided black bishop also threat yes light square bishop king indian vital attacking possibilities always wan na lose bishop help got bringing knights particular moment interesting keep going yeah play rook f standard rooks come take take actually exception rule normally king indian wan na break pawn chain four pawns row connect four break exception almost variations king indian almost always retreat bishop guard pawn bishop break pawn chain exception rule actually worried white able push pawn probably best game ever played keeps going g yep diagonal looks threatening right like white basically trying guard king gon na retreat bishop c g see second actually quite yet yeah goes trying guard king bishop g able keep attacking next case made take pawn would actually mistake mean high level mistake white actually recapture pawn yeah high level oh pawn pawn ends front king yeah stops white white king attacked basically oh interesting pawn stopping king attacked cool yeah pressure continues right sack wait wait sack oh knight takes pawn yeah strengths weaknesses throwing knight abyss well basically gon na destroying protection front white king white pawn willing take risks basically wan na open king try checkmate checkmate probably gon na lose game center board yeah nice moves pawn takes pawn take white takes queen push pawn forward checkmate give second knight taking losing pieces left right right pushing pawn forward check takes pawn rook check check check nonstop yeah theme though keep going checkmate pawn bishop square front king see queen still hanging fact actually sack queen never took queen could take queen would checkmate got constantly mean sacrifice actually yeah could take would gotten checkmated anyway smoke clears material win game game would say favorite game stand mean beautiful fact mainly able offer queen sacrifice many moves row almost never opportunity actually normally games gon na consider best involve sacrifices sacrifice queen makes memorable constant theme one checkmate idea often play sacrifice major piece like often find position pretty rare players tend avoid sorts situations players like games go either way like players sort cooperate want kind game order situation arise lot games top neither player wants go situation part really opportunities nevertheless stockfish loves opportunities sacrifices well one thing also starting learn stockfish programs care pawns sacrifice one pawn two pawns three pawns lot cases rest pieces active something kind knew basic level initiative call chess like give material pieces well placed realize important computers time time even actually like variant fisher random another variant arrange piece back row gladly sack rooks bishops knights time time take material imbalance material give matter much attack pieces certain squares well long hold attack right computers also tricky humans sometimes look opening variation see something like wan na game problem know supposed follow afterwards know follow afterwards oftentimes make mistakes try look human way course end losing longterm given much material sword dramatic people love kinds sacrifices putting line game game also queen sacrifice game polish player michael krasnkowski played barcelona believe also sacrificed queen one pawn bring king middle board actually sacrificed yes sacrifice took pawn sacrificed pawn wan na go game sure yeah absolutely black yes yeah game skip forward like th move roughly opening think like catalan says yeah basically catalan opening generally slow declined yeah yeah sack queen pawn sorry take knight first sorry knight c keep going way pawn structure mess missing yeah take knight take knight rook yeah discovery queen attack takes knight rook b attacking queen got get got yeah throw throw queen middle check check king wait minute right yeah one pawn queen pawn pawn yeah king takes queen thinking crazy madman king king go board king vulnerable position gon na keep checking yes bishop checks king rook checks knight checks see ahead time yeah mean figured way win king many attacking pieces end could well basically king piece sort guard king queen piece keep checking gon na able win goes think played yeah played move ooh check threatening move rook one square make checkmate got rook takes knight take right back check still wan na scoot rook check h square dark square think resign make move oh resigned yeah resign yeah moved rook dark square front pawn would checkmate dark square front pawn h yeah bishop covers light square something mess really think way stop checkmate nothing queen nothing queen guess gon na lose queen yeah think actually forced checkmate couple moves think way stop even loses queens yeah forced checkmate fascinating like ca purely calculate intuition also think situations know least draw could always check rook wanted make draw also gives margin calculate play move calculate work still make draw mean fun sacrifices sort serious competitive online events board actually quite frequently wish opportunities top level chess become harder harder due computers everybody well prepared opening know first like moves sequences matter room creativity less less makes means less less types games think played levy gotham chess without queen thing think bullet game yeah one minute game think yeah actual thing pull like would like levy yeah guess somebody like levy bullet maybe win like probably bullet timing one minute whole game one minute whole game okay mean much miss queen gone international master know bullet game like said maybe bullet maybe score blitz game anything anything slower maybe maybe one win maybe one yeah topic goat let ask paul morphy good reddit asked ask tragic figure chess yeah paul morphy best player world bigger margin probably anyone else recent modern history would say roughly using today ratings around like opinion best players maybe around best best player bigger margin fisher example think points better boris spassky morphy plus least modern standards would probably strong im saying whole lot time one even close think put category like best ever simply best player long enough period time far tragic tragic essentially quit chess competition think like magnus talking world championship feeling like competitive enough morphy one could even beat probably individual games ended quitting chess think sort like lawyer kind spent probably last think last years life nothing actually seen grave new orleans lived think brennan mistaken something like tragic one competitive time far best ever think say goat still think top using criteria players better peers big big margin think world championship think magnus stepping still see height chess still think merit world championship way time game always evolving one things changed lot recent times lot blitz tournaments also rapid tournaments past classical chess golden standard thing mattered last probably years slowly surely probably many rapid slash blitz tournaments classical tournaments maybe quite top level least feels like getting close terms world championship feel biggest issue many draws games exciting games inevitably end draw single biggest reason players six months prepare match example canada tournament played june july ended think around july th world championship match probably february march nine months players much time prepare going weaknesses opening phase game players likely going solid lot draws many cases might come tie breaks magnus fact two matches karjakin karawana win rapid tie breaks think magnus feel like format right think feels long many draws get play creative exciting chess think pushed hard change format know right change would think format becoming little bit antiquated classical games want change format one suggestion mentioned think probably still valid match held maybe one month candidate tournament determine challenger held one month event probably way keep format think players time prepare something crazy compare candidates classical tournaments let say louis played recently played wrap blitz sink filled cup think like september th something like point players probably came week two prepare tournament us championship players little bit time prepare play event normally players long breaks prepare long periods time well prepared still lot exciting games window preparation much smaller pretty close given things rolled opportunity compete world championship hence copia meme still quite understand magnus friends enemies frenemies status relationship yeah think rivalries chess everybody tries hype like everyone hates thing end day yes competitive wan na beat whether magnus top players also realize small world like lot us able make living playing game professionals alluded earlier top players make living even though competitive wan na beat certain level respect sort brotherhood would say us would say frenemies think simplest way putting love magnus carlsen human human think similar actually use comparison tennis roger federer feels like magnus everything comes easily example seen situation hans niemann somehow rolled right back playing amazing chess latest event really easy seems make look know like tennis sport played lot followed closely remember hearing andy roddick say federer like somehow handles pressure makes look easy feel way magnus seems easy know playing games stress pressure magnus ever see sure probably witness would say easy sad see federer retire know greatness know lionel messi retire also sad certain people singular history sport know gon na another messi know gon na another federer yeah long time greatest ever would say definitely mean grew nadal fan actually felt like nadal never looked easy exact opposite like nadal feels like always running every ball exerting looked really really hard like since nothing really came easily chess relate time especially federer started losing seems human started really liking well think federer changed game know say greatest ever game changed forever yeah certain people last thing back sanpras agassi everybody okay wins chess boxing match magnus probably magnus taller also reach taller reach yeah think would win question reddit sport think beat magnus times think could beat magnus times tennis mean took lessons eight years try go hit two three times every week think could beat tennis backhand forehand style tennis play wish taller really like trying come net like volling lot rod laver rod laver short able make work like years ago really like volling little bit short kind stay back mean normally hit like try hit hard forehands try slice backhand mentioned magnus keriakin wonder ideas thoughts fact originally qualifier candidates tournament disqualified fide breaching code ethics related support russian invasion ukraine ever seep games play board geopolitics actual military conflict feel pressure battles nations nepal know russian america mean every nation profound way represented chessboard right never really felt think actually eyeopening realize difficult lot russian chess players right play situation even netbo matter remember louis essentially bring cash obviously russia cut swift credit cards work russians cash ca play know lot fled country try keep chess career going tough situation obviously ukrainians suffering really really bad know netbo talked seen talked politics geopolitics think really mean feel like players try avoid talking think difficult remember louis another russian player peter savidler basically asked like get started ca ca talk think probably side spectrum think probably supportive going right difficult situation really feel like manifests actual like tensions play like russian players mean maybe younger playing certain events one country felt like maybe actually felt tension really wanted go way win chinese perhaps maybe one time felt something along lines generally feel like treat players individuals country represent yeah let go back philosophical chess find beautiful game chess looking back whole career think looking back really board also like memories created think fact able travel chess meet many people playing great game different nationalities different backgrounds probably thing really like chess one maybe thing think people different backgrounds different ages honestly someone billionaire talking someone like kid inner city talking game chess level think really applicable anything else world level respect communicated game probably single beautiful thing sort chess chess world terms game creativity possibility different positions learning something new even played game years inspiring knowing spent time still new things learn probably two biggest things would refer memories big small like weird surprising anecdotes years going different places stand darker times weirder times like weird places played weird people played weird people hung anything jumps memory think probably little bit like political think one things great whenever go play tournaments certain impression country like people like probably best example actually sorry think played fide world cup held tripoli capital libya time gaddafi still running country hear lot things go see people friendly sort look without believing things go places see things truly generally find different media portray one great regrets someone loves history going see magnus lepta greatest ruins think greatest ruins africa roman times course longer exists really regret think another thing unique chess us even compete children like lot people like nepo others known long time lot people longer play chess competitively inevitably end talking people many years road never truly lose touch game people grew playing many people like connected last couple years knew kid went something else still end talking able share old memories said bit student fan history even ancient history cultures periods time people human history draw wisdom human nature particularly drawn lot mean probably study mostly like like ancient roman history empire course ancient persia another subject studied lot ask would say mean depends talking like military generals talking like philosophers mean yeah right philosophers people thought world course military people sort conquered lands interesting part seems far away today cool see people kind ability invent amazing things maybe different willingness go war think mean one favorite books read last couple years history herodotus mean basically consider father history mean really love reading things like thermopylae marathon great ancient battles know like specific like quote wording something like come one favorite books history far books written long time ago yeah like think like bc written like like reading seem ancient seem ancient like sort feel like one things really like getting away technology opportunity trying disconnect sorts things read books like besides general interest sort reminds like really life without stuff least point something kind relate like humanity flourishes without stuff take think fundamental current culture like find beautiful humanity still exist without technology yes definitely really good reminder given contrast course beautiful midst technology streaming like streaming somehow feels many large percentage young people interested like consumes streams feels represent like future many people kind develop mind watching twitch youtube right mean definitely true like remember little bit younger like around would actually try one day week weekend try look like computer phone phones today obviously able pretty easily hard like try go one day recently tried like actually pulled books garage started reading foreign concept read lot always ipad kindle yeah actually weird try get away mean another thing like said really like going nature opportunity spent lot time colorado example hiking ers one life goals go get top every single one try disconnect course hard whether disconnecting take perfect day life fikaru nakamura day big chess match well actually multiple days right take one big chess match one like representative average day perfect chess day although would start like night would get like nine hours sleep like consistent nine hours like say nine example let say round starts like two nine say preparation one go eat lunch one two nap walk something completely unrelated would perfect day everything except preparation thinking chess trying think chess trying think chess definitely tricks well find like go outside try hear like birds try listen one like meditation kind things like always say meditate try hear breathing like close eyes try hear breathing focus try things like time time well terms getting nine hours sleep come difficult almost never happens mean couple times happened like norway specifically generally sleep well chess terms wish talking perfect day sleep really important diet stuff like yeah think lot people try keep light round actually like remember hearing story peter savidler years back russian gm said kasparov would go eat like big steak right game would completely fine think players exact opposite try like eat like snacks like maybe nuts bars things nature maybe like maybe fish something light lunch game probably eat lot game generally try think like specific diet makes huge difference everyone different course actually board perfect day maintain focus many hours classical chess like know like minute minute second second able maintain focus tricks difficult think really depends type game playing think game calm slow lot happens start lot easier super focused like mind drift whatnot critical moment sort zone easiest ones think generally games complicated start trying let mind wander games complicated like one things never good mind wander always like always worrying next move like blunder going like gon na trying think much block noise think actually hardest thing also like say played magnus times gotten winning positions moment winning position oftentimes mind wanders like okay win game like okay happens game win game gain rating points different things actually game yet think lot players hardest thing get winning position mind drift drifts like happens game outcome drifting future stay moment really hold also yeah probably getting excited win makes worse playing interesting like well think getting like nervous like excited think like waiting end expect end opponent keeps defending make mistakes flip side start getting frustrated like try recover kind thing difficult think try try basically focus every single move try try block noise matter direction going try best mean sometimes poor like good job blocking noise think generally try think okay make next move make opponent find best moves keep game going matter keep going way long day classical chess look like pretty brutal mean would something like okay game starts two done stuff game probably goes like two seven example maybe two eight five six hours probably eat dinner hour maybe clear like go clear head minutes immediately right back studying couple hours reviewing previous games already generally moving next game trying matter happened put behind win lose draw okay also another question lot people wonder play classical tournaments sort gets back know literally care sort stuff going play tournaments wan na able give best shot feel going play like play balance schedule carefully gon na go play tournament simply feel put work right thing also taking away spot somebody else probably putting work want compete event look candidates lot people say well playing like okay qualify gon na take seriously give everything tournament always much ca gon na play perfect day life car oh perfect day perfect day would something along lines get early like three four morning drive hour away go climb mountains perfect day mountains oh mean normal non yeah yeah perfectly productive normal day oh perfectly productive okay perfectly productive would along lines wake like eight probably watch either bloomberg cnbc minutes hour watch markets maybe hour two look certain things going really care investing follow quite closely yeah follow markets closely closer yes personal reasons comment like personal investing reasons like philosophical understanding going world sort everything think first obviously interested investing many many years done investing trading least decade like interested level also quite interested well see policy dictated like look last six months specifically see fed policy around things like interest rates unemployment things nature something interests also invest real estate aside stock market therefore always keeping eye sorts things always looking better example like looking trends go back think could year wrong pattern found fed minutes came believe two two think wednesday third wednesday every month gold would actually gold etfs etns would actually go every single wednesday month minutes came would follow things like course like trading huge volume found trend course stopped working certain point sorts things interest even something make living trying spot trends always something fascinated one reddit said shorted tesla time ago regret well plays small amounts money via puts would buy puts put spreads something straight shorting would never actually worth risk want ever situation think sorts things think better example period actually shortly candidates actually oil long position oil oil completely crashed went think went go even went low course saudis cutting think cutting cutting production anyway period big long position one x oil etfs kept going day day day course right near bottom finally could take anymore took loss really sort difficult dealing stress every day looking seeing losses kind decided would never put situation like shorting separately think posted reply comment tesla started going actually started selling puts quite well sort play sides never like become hard set conviction like refuse like like go like go sure willing adapt think shorting legal think ethical like know much investing feel like feels wrong know something overinflated good opposing force like balance something like feels like current modern internet world think tesla vaguely saw somewhere like shorted stock like ever incentivizes lot publication misinformation like feels like incentives wrong look markets future human civilization perspective feels like shorting somehow wrong maybe misunderstanding broader picture markets well actually try like almost take long positions specifically feel like betting betting like world collapsing feel like morally wan na wan na viewpoint think know sort another thing noticed like lucky traveled lot met lot famous people one thing noticed like lot lot people successful ones optimistic matter happening day day remain optimistic future things going try end situation think far like shorting specifically real danger anybody invest feel like actually apps like robinhood go way try make seem like fun game like seen people place trade like gives like stickers like confetti like wait second going whole game like people sort going wrong thing think shorting like banned think dangerous everybody access able things like according reddit topic tesla trouble admitting make mistake true generally true actually think wait reddit accurate truthful representation character fascinating think thing learned obviously good chess automatically mean genius everything else feel like another thing actually really really admire magnus world champion best player automatically believe translates every area life feel like world champions think great matter like intentionally trying rude feel like certain people feel like like anything say right authority reality like authorities comes chess like know chess best experts automatically mean geniuses everything else said think said somewhere could c squared podcast forget chess streaming taught generalize various like feel like able things streaming know specifically streaming think streaming taught lot sort life also run business honestly like read lot business books one things streaming start like small thing maybe couple people help along way becomes bigger bigger boom suddenly start hire employees basically running business like learned lot book read years back think mary buffett warren buffett tries like buys companies management stays anything actually try things kind way like try couple people around leave lot general decisions like things really important obviously involved try things like streaming learn lot along way think done probably several potential careers could really wanted almost generalizing terms takes build business ground process becoming successful streamer learned takes start ground single person build business multiple people successful attribute success streamer mean many things think strong chess player following incredibly important start think anybody whether chess whatever field following begin career whatever activity video game already big step begin definitely played big role think though fans hearing people feel mean trolls obviously positive messages hear hear people struggling life whether say heard people talk cancer hear someone going divorce trying make day day hear things like think really puts perspective means end day really fans give motivation reason meet fans person like couple events like talking hearing story knowing bring joy end day bring people joy someone working like factory day someone middle country bring joy chest means lot kid example inspire take chess serious way even honestly learn chess certain skills like critical thinking leads becoming like great scientist something road ultimately hoping hope come mean gave strength turn mean know much stream lot day day day able put content comment challenge maybe low points able overcome actually feel lows think main reason feel lows end day fortunate even chess player fortunate travel world meet people lived great life see streamer well bringing joy people feel like position maybe wrong say mental health important feel like lucky really right complain really feel lows way times certain things like reddit otherwise get nerves little bit able realize fortunate generally struggle lows much speaking reddit trolls reddit asked ask tell story chess bay reddit moderator pitted eric hansen also known chess bro saying things know much eric hansen guess eric another grandmaster guys drama tension also ask tell like best eric hansen human would say whole streamers whole boom chess certain people certain entities important happened lot people right place right time chess bras levy well kind right place right time personalities alone enough need people push things lot things said chess bay end day way view pretty straightforward agree manner things pushed directory chess twitch forward way would possible anybody else time example directly pushing needed someone pushing look whole boom actually happened twitch many ways think responsible levy bras us extremely fortunate someone pushing forward really involved time never would gotten sort look say okay agree happened needed someone like gon na push push really hard get chess today comment happened people clue talking useful think specifically useful get think lot layers people felt things like abuses power things nature lot things said know wan na super negative happened specifically one thing people note prior happen april think lot collaborations chess world much together whole lot streamers things together happened april big sort separation lot streamers went directions happened mean whole story lot course think fair say comment times tuned streaming world hate see silos created one reasons fan good friend joe rogan call collaborations basically everybody supporting gets excited promotes competitive feeling streamers sometimes noticed natural siloing effect know exactly maybe drama somehow good views clicks kind stuff know hate see love seeing kind friendship collaboration kind stuff think also goes try super negative also goes chess world whole one things chess world long time talking online like chess world fortunate seen couple booms busts late actually late mid period time intel ibm tech companies big chess pc grand prix world championship held new york think deep blue stuff later late garry kasparov lot interest time sort went flames couple different reasons also late maybe mid group seattle big chess hosted us championship different things lot booms busts course go way back fisher boom well inevitably leads busts thing leads end day people chess world natural tendency want work together want hang whatever piece chess world opposed thinking standpoint good one good one things situation seen booms busts remember younger would oftentimes think like chess bigger struggle much grow game think see reason position also tough know happened try learn past still feels hard break feels tough also difficult another thing people kind misunderstand time time talk actually talk levy incomes well main reason talk want inspire like fide governing bodies others feel like wow people success like surely something different change things somehow happened way disheartening wan na see interest chess wan na see sponsors general public getting excited game one things difficult yeah wan na see innovation parts everybody also organizations like inspire large number people streamers constantly innovating guess reach large audience forget put little love oh wanted ask eric eric yeah yeah yeah yeah little love like best eric hansen human think mainly charismatic charismatic knows brand pretend fake like knows brand owns people know know grandmaster strong yeah strong grandmaster also like creator yeah one earliest major chess content creators twitch like educational stuff mix mix educational mix high level entertainment okay yeah okay awesome historical chess figure think would best streams historical chess figure would say probably mikhail tal former world champion lived exciting life let put somebody drank latvia called magician riga drank lot smoked lot lot stuff well oh like sex drugs rock roll kind yeah think look like actually even top grandmasters like even world champs top grandmasters probably interesting life far far even like example much loved chess character think dying like think maybe dying actually left hospital go play blitz tournament moscow actually beat garry kasparov blitz tournament one games age probably like late fifties mid fifties late fifties mean drank much died young yeah like left hospital moscow went play blitz tournament beat kasparov well first push back think died young impactful people like churchill quite bit drinking smoking kind stuff still brilliant things even partake old whiskey drugs rock roll women okay streaming though quote mean love steve jobs quote never connect dots looking forwards connect looking backwards look got streaming things happened along way beneficial first thing would young growing played lot blitz chess internet chess club one predecessors cameras audio things one thing people could commit would write comments games things nature actually something similar instead talking writing chatting games playing something beneficial without think would able success streaming think would taken much longer get used feel comfortable already built advantage additionally younger think remember exactly actually tv well tv cable watch tv growing listened radio lot listened lot baseball games new york yankees specifically think listening games like sort heard lot announcers think also one things learn see kind growing examples think beneficial third thing terms like flares growing homeschooled probably great courses think still great courses remember guy professor watched dvds lectures would always dress someone like middle ages would dress sort like orator would explain like know happened sort style also something obviously something consciously like internalize think something well watched courses seeing style oration really helped lot streamer yeah yeah little experiences contributed life definitely something think took pretty nonlinear path life think somehow get integrated picture connect idea good chess important part success streaming think like really good advice people good like order creator podcast create videos kind stuff stream feel like enriches pursue whole heart something else outside like obviously level chess developed passion pursuit something outside know passion kind think sure think streaming something first feel like going empty time reason seen lows people hit passion pursuit outside streaming also make better creator interesting think think podcasting applies like rogan think would reason podcast good passion put comedian fight commentator like podcast side hobby way feel main passion outside know think puts everything proper context also allows mentally escape place find deeply fulfilling mentioned like offline told interested found interesting said renting particular place always rent sense freedom gives mean tend actually try minimalist part comes things like clothes like owning like cars example watch like lot material things really interest end day one thing might actually play role lot like hiccups get maybe closer world champion one things time young like grow like wealthy background like single mother first six years life worked elementary teacher support brother like saw lot sort lows life early even remarry like money stepfather made lot directed towards like mom like traveling tournaments internationally even us seeing struggles like actually made chess player goes back investing well kind like wan na secure certain point always looked like get point end day like said experiences seeing like actually even stepfather years old still teaches chess time probably works harder actually see things like really interested like get point point b large part led said obviously start owning things like properties houses condos whatnot headaches come along getting bills mail see age away tenant parking car illegally pay fees sorts things kind pain try mean try reduce number things really bother life really thing let let one things things kind ties way still feel pretty free though part despite owning mentioned security meaning like security stability kind thing yeah sorry thing chase value comes chess said pro player well make couple hundred thousand dollars year course talking poorly one year income dries chance never get back feel like much career always mind maybe held back degree know sort thoughts things like opposed purely focused chess like worrying results worrying prizes things like might held back always something mind really worked hard make sure philosophically intellectually spiritually every way okay nothing close nothing get reason want freedom crave stability rather stability bar stability low gives freedom take big risks thought felt like way could really help world optimizing positive take big risks big risks really mean potentially losing everything saying like startups mean like yeah startups every aspect meaning pivoting career paths completely everybody else telling actually interesting think streaming like start investing money lose everything successful also big risk time professional player well kind started october still top world well actually bad year started playing much worse towards end intended take six month break last time played november india gon na take break us championship april sense actually take risk potentially risking career spending extra time streaming like risk like financially lose everything actually bit risk think sense lose career player guarantee streaming gon na anything anything substantial think risk time think time know thought something fun spend time like somehow know figured six month break would come back play better chess kind like stream far streaming never thought something would career something viable thought something fun maybe gives gives fans access broadens platform people hear really ever expect become said growing single mother giving whole life chess certain point low points maybe times felt lonely isolated maybe even depressed oh absolutely chess difficult like friends people compete friends end day singular pursuit results dictate everything many moments throughout life like struggled think probably biggest time happened would stopped playing chess went college mainly gotten level top world stagnated year decided go college primarily stagnated feel like going anywhere also kind friends chess world kind wonder like especially homeschooled well like added kind wanting around people really played big role decision go college end day realized college kind big disappointment strongest biggest strength playing chess mingle people different backgrounds different ages went college whole notion basically people juniors seniors important equal others animal farm line like situation really jive childhood growing world chess one biggest reasons actually came back chess cause like world certain people important things different like could really relate one biggest reasons really reason reason though towards end first semester played tournament studying actually college actually studying class mainly poker started playing poker night long like towards end semester actually went play tournament philadelphia cause going college nearby little preparation tournament strong grandmasters kind made think well okay ever gon na take chance stay college four years probably get like know probably get major political science something political arena felt like gon na probably look back like five years wonder like played chess far could gone taken four years would opportunity reach full potential even see far go therefore also big big reason another question play chess mentioned political possible successful trajectory might depends point really asked question think talking time college probably would done something political science maybe lobbyists something terrible like honestly little bit younger know really loved ancient history archeology also languages well probably something along lines talk like recently something finance know exactly something finance think like talk years think years honestly wan na believe know sitting like beach house malibu relaxing yeah right like yacht reason yacht paid yacht ever wan na yacht okay right fine mean like amount money waste docking fees gas like way way trying construct example super rich reason actually know think actually appeal think one another great thing chess within chess world prominent famous go supermarket nobody recognized famous famous time actually wan na like want situation everyone recognizes super famous sounds like miserable life want tmz chasing street famous community love whenever plug community always like deep connection always escape need break advice would give young people career life maybe high school maybe college maybe wan na achieve high see achieved chess wan na something care yeah think main thing follow heart follow passion one thing touch like parents mom musician good think like maybe state california growing violin still nowhere near good enough get juilliard top music schools pursue career lot starving musicians never able quite make like see mom happened passion fact able make stepfather talked stepfather actually sri lankan descent comes family lawyers father lawyer uncle lawyer international court justice family lawyers stepfather went england study law went southampton think university southampton point going playing tournaments weekend playing school club things parents actually took away chessboard took away chess books took everything away told going become lawyer could play chess look upbringing feel lucky parents experiences supportive everything think end day pursue passion whatever end might might pursue might fail think pursue better word better tried failed tried really believe important thing takes knows experiences feel much important like ifs possibly missing living life even know everybody around judgment says going financially viable still pursue think mean point make tough decisions absolutely feel like many people follow standard route like supposed know go college get degree debt sorts things end day really living pursuing want pursue supposed society tells us route supposed go think pursue course certain point making make hard decisions think know life thing really know time sort experiences things really ca put price yeah know really pursue know even like streaming see people like youtube kind stuff world may waste foreign like levels game like way really pursue way guess point like know keep hobby make full time passion go sometimes people think like things love hobby like music something like way seriously go yeah well probably general advice like whatever pursue even chess dropped college guarantee gon na make professional player guarantee like took chance fortunately worked would rather fight duck hundred horses probably duck one enemy better keep eye stress anxiety like hundred mean tiny tiny know feel like well know gon na attack feel like one enemy seeing like clear objective would always prefer could someone else day alive dead would would wan na day pick someone actually would probably pick elon many years ago rockets blowing interested see processes went got side cause like feel like time hear startups like okay look amazon big investment start feel like super super lows like amazons world maybe three rocks blew maybe fourth fifth one actually succeeded somewhere timeframe yeah probably one lowest lows ever publicly ever seen yeah yeah moments make us everyone earth disappeared horrible atrocity left would days look like would dead bodies everywhere movie like right many movies like honestly could would probably saying like life plants none stuff life life human life human life like goats stuff remember reading mean slightly book read many years ago think rendezvous rama think people going land like cylinder think explored like walked bicycle maybe plant trees things nature wonder would experience change experience nature knowing truly cause like one magical things nature humbling like love love going like hiking cause obviously get exercise honestly reminder small really would realize like mean extra humbling effect like really alone yeah know probably spent lot time thinking thinking everything hate losing chess love winning hate losing love winning think love winning mean maybe cause many different things like losing effect think like definitely love winning think younger hated losing much liked winning comforts bad days think similar gives motivation streaming fact end day matter bad things appear seem mean never better time human history people things much better time find hard really pity pity like feel really bad use sorts things like way get knowing lucky role love human condition let ask car love love mean think greatest thing world think things fall apart like quite times actually really real highs really real lows well think love inspire things never thought possible without though think life empty think probably important thing life one way another extra sad last person left earth right exactly yeah mean think also terms chess think far chess goes competition greatest thing world also worst thing world love lot chess players many help actually makes play much worse chess energy drive kind way mixed chess far personally though think would say said better loved lost never loved definitely thought care thought care turns care sometimes little bit tiny bit tiny bit hikaru amazing person huge fan really honor would talk today ca wait see next thank good thanks listening
