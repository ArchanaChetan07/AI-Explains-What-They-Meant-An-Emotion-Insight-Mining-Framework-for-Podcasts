 There was a five year waiting list. And we got a rotary telephone. But it dramatically changed our lives. People would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. I would have to go all the way to the hospital to get black test records. And it would take two hours to go. And they would say, sorry, it's not ready. Come back the next day. Two hours to come back. And that became a five minute thing. So it's a kid, like I mean, this light bulb went in my head. You know, this power of technology to kind of change people's lives. We had no running water. You know, it was a massive drought. So they would get water in these trucks. Maybe eight buckets per household. Some me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would wait in line, get that and bring it back home. Many years later, like we had running water and we had a water heater. And you would get hot water to take a shower. I mean, like, so you know, for me, everything was discreet like that. And so I've always had this thing, you know, first-hand feeling of like how technology can dramatically change. Like your life and like the opportunity it brings. I think if Pedom is actually high, at some point, all of humanity is like aligned in making sure that's not the case. Right. And so we'll actually make more progress against it. I think so. The irony is, so there is a self-modulating aspect there. Like I think if humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it is, I think we can get there. So because of that, I think I'm optimistic on the P-DOOM scenarios. But that doesn't mean, I think the underlying risk is actually pretty high. But I'm, you know, I have a lot of faith in humanity, kind of, rising up to the, to meet that moment. Take me through that experience when there's all these articles saying, you're the wrong guy to leave Google through this. Google's loss is done. It's over. The following is a conversation with Sundar Pachai, the CEO of Google and alphabet on this The Lex Friedman podcast. Your life story is inspiring to a lot of people. It's inspiring to me. You grew up in India, whole family living in a humble, two room apartment, very little, almost no access to technology. And from those humble beginnings, you rose to lead a $2 trillion technology company. So if you could travel back in time and told that, let's say 12 year old Sundar, you're not leading one of the largest companies in human history. What do you think that young kid would say? I would have probably laughed it off. You know, probably too far fetched to imagine or believe at that time. You would have to explain the internet first for sure. Me computers to me at that time. You know, I was 12 in 1984. So probably, you know, by then I had started reading about them. I hadn't seen one. What was that place like? Take me to a childhood. Now I grew up in Chennai. It's in South of India. It's a beautiful bustling city. Lots of people, lots of energy. You know, simple life, definitely, like foreign memories of playing cricket outside the home. We just used to play on the streets. All the neighborhood kids would come out and we would play till it got dark and we couldn't play anymore. Therefore, traffic would come. We would just stop the game. Everything would drive through and you would just continue playing, right? Just to kind of get the visual in your head. You know, pre computers is a lot of free time. Now that I think about it, now you have to go and seek that quiet solitude or something. Newspapers, books, is how I gained access to the was information at the time you will. My grandfather was a big influence. He worked in the post office. He was so good with language. His English, you know, he's handwriting till today is the most beautiful handwriting I've ever seen. He would write so clearly, he was so articulate. And so he kind of got me introduced into books. He loved politics. So we could talk about anything. And you know, that was there in my family throughout. So lots of books, trashy books, good books, everything from iron, brand to books on philosophy to stupid crime novels. So books was a big part of my life, but the kind of this soul, it's not surprising. I ended up at Google because Google's mission kind of always resonated deeply with me. This access to knowledge, I was hungry for it, but definitely have a phone memories of my childhood. Access to knowledge was there. So that's the well we had. You know, every aspect of technology I had to wait for a while, I've obviously spoken before about how long it took for us to get a phone, about five years, but it's not the only thing. A telephone. There was a five year wait list. And we got a rotary telephone, but it dramatically changed our lives. You know, people would come to our house to make calls to their loved ones. You know, I would have to go all the way to the hospital to get blood test records. And it would take two hours to go. And they would say, sorry, it's not ready. Come back the next day, two hours to come back. And that became a five minute thing. So it's a kid like I mean, this light bulb went in my head. You know, this power of technology to kind of change people's lives. We had no running water. You know, it was a massive drought. So they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight buckets per household. Some me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would wait in line, get that and bring it back home. Many years later, like we had running water and we had a water heater. And you would get hot water to take a shower. I mean, like, so you know, for me, everything was discreet like that. And so I've always had this thing, you know, first and feeling of like how technology can dramatically change, like your life and like the opportunity it brings. So, you know, that was kind of a subliminal takeaway for me throughout growing up. And you know, I kind of actually observed it and felt it, you know, so we had to convince my dad for a long time to get a BC already. You know what a BC RS, yeah. I'm trying to date you now. But you know, because before that, you only had like kind of one TV channel. Right. That's it. And so you know, you can watch movies or something like that. But this is by the time I was in 12th grade, we got a VCR, you know, it was a, like a Panasonic, which we had to go to some like shop, which had kind of smuggled it in, I guess. And that's where we bought a VCR. But then being able to record like a World Cup football game and then or like get put like videotapes and watch movies like all that. So like, you know, I had these discrete memories growing up. And so you always left me with the feeling of like how getting access to technology drives that step change in your life. I don't think you'll ever be able to equal the first time you get hot water to have that convenience of going and opening a tap and have hot water come out. Yeah. It's interesting. We take for granted the progress we've made. If you look at human history, just those plots that look at GDP across 2000 years, and you see that exponential growth to where most of the progress happens since the industrial revolution. And we just take for granted, we forget how far we've gone. So our ability to understand how great we have it. And also how quickly technology can improve is quite poor. Oh, it's extraordinary. You know, I go back to India now, the power of mobile. You know, it's mind blowing to see the progress through the arc of time. It's phenomenal. What advice would you give to young folks listening to this all over the world? Who look up to you and find your story inspiring? Who want to be maybe the next one, Derbucciye? Who want to start create companies, build something has a lot of impact in the world. Look, it's you have a lot of luck along the way. But you obviously have to make smart choices. You're thinking about what you want to do. Your brain is telling you something. But when you do things, I think it's important to kind of get that. Listen to your heart and see whether you actually enjoy doing it, right? That feeling of if you love what you do, it's so much easier. And you're going to see the best version of yourself. It's easier said than done. I think it's tough to find things you love doing. But I think kind of listening to your heart a bit more than your mind in terms of figuring out what you want to do. I think it's one of the best things I would tell people. The second thing is trying to work with people who you feel at various points in my life. I've worked with people who I felt were better than me. You almost are sitting in a room talking to someone and they're like, wow. You want that feeling a few times. Trying to get to yourself in a position where you're working with people who you feel are kind of like stretching your abilities is what helps you grow, I think. So putting yourself in uncomfortable situations. And I think often you'll surprise yourself. So I think being open-minded enough to kind of put to yourself in those positions is maybe, maybe another thing I would say. Well, lessons can we learn? And from an outsider perspective, for me, looking at your story and gotten to know you a bit, your humble, your kind, usually when I think of somebody who has had a journey like yours and climbs to the very top of leadership, they're in a cut-throat world, they're usually going to be a bit of an asshole. So what was then when we supposed to draw from the fact that your general approach is of balance, of humility, of kindness listening to everybody? What's your secret? I do get angry, I do get frustrated, I have the same emotions all of us do right in the context of work and everything. But a few things, I think, you know, over time I figured out the best way to get the most out of people. You know, you kind of find mission oriented people who are in the shared journey, who have just inner drive to excellence to do the best. And you know, you kind of motivate people and you can achieve a lot that way. Right? And so it often tends to work out that way. But have there been times like, you know, I lose it? Yeah, but you know, maybe less often than others. And maybe over the years, less and less so because, you know, I find it's not needed to achieve what you need to do. So losing your shit has not been productive? Less often than not. I think people respond to that. Yeah. They may do stuff to react to that. Like what you actually want them to do the right thing. And so, you know, maybe there's a bit of like sports, you know, a sports fan in football coaches in soccer, that football. You know, people often talk about like man management, right? Great coaches too. Right? I think there is an element of that in our lives. Maybe you get the best out of the people you work with. You know, at times you're working with people who are so committed to achieving, if they've done something wrong, they feel it more than you do, right? So you treat them differently. And, you know, occasionally there are people who you need to clearly let them know like there wasn't okay or whatever it is. But I've often found that not to be the case. And sometimes the right words at the right time, spoken firmly can reverberate through time. Also sometimes the unspoken words. You know, people can sometimes see that like, you know, you're unhappy without you saying it. And so sometimes the silence can deliver that message even more. Sometimes less is more. Who's the greatest soccer player of all time? Messier or Naldo or Pele or Maradona? I'm going to make, you know, in this question. Is this going to be a political answer? No, I will tell the truthful answer, which is that the question is messy. You know, it's been interesting because my son is a big Christian or Naldo fan. And so we've had to watch El Classico's together, you know, with that dynamic in there. I so admire CR7s. I mean, I've never seen an athlete more committed to that kind of excellence. And so he's one of the all time grades, but you know, for me, Messier is it? Yeah, when I see Len on a messy, you just are in awe that humans are able to achieve that level of greatness and genius and artistry. When we talk, we'll talk about AI, maybe robotics and this kind of stuff, that level of genius. I'm not sure you can possibly match by AI in a long time. It's just an example of greatness. And you have that kind of greatness and other disciplines, but in sport, you get to visually see it, on like anything else. And just the timing, the movement, this is genius. I had the chance to see him a couple of weeks ago. He played in San Jose against the quake. So I went to see it, see the game was a fan on the had good seats, knew where you would play in the second half, hopefully. And even at his age, just watching him when he gets the ball, that movement, you know, you're right, that special quality. Stuff to describe, but you feel it when you see it, yeah. He's still got it. If we rank all the technological innovations throughout human history, let's go back. Maybe the history of human civilization is 12,000 years ago. And you rank them by the how much of a productivity multiplier they've been. So we can go to electricity or the labor mechanization of the industrial revolution, or we can go back to the first agricultural revolution 12,000 years ago. In that long list of inventions, do you think AI, when history is written 1,000 years from now, do you think it has a chance to be the number one productivity multiplier? It's a great question. Look, many years ago, I think it might have been 2017 or 2018. You know, I said at that time, like, you know, AI is the most profound technology humanity will ever work on. It will be more profound than fire or electricity. So I have to back myself, I, you know, I still think that's the case. You know, when he asked this question, I was thinking, well, do we have a recency bias, right? You know, like it sports, it's very tempting to call the current person. You're seeing the greatest player, right? And so is there a recency bias? And, you know, I do think from first principles, I would argue, AI will be bigger than all of those. I didn't live through those moments, you know, two years ago, I had to go through a surgery and then I processed that there was a point in time people didn't have anesthesia when they went through these procedures. At that moment, I was like, that has got to be the greatest inventor in humanity has ever ever done, right? So, look, we don't know what it is to have lived through those times. But, you know, many of what you're talking about, we're kind of this general things, which pretty much affected everything, you know, electricity or internet, etc. But, I don't think we've ever dealt with the technology, both which is progressing so fast, becoming so capable. It's not clear what the ceiling is. And, the main unique, it's recursively self-improving, right? It's capable of that. And so, the fact it is going, it's the first technology will kind of dramatically accelerate creation itself, like creating things, building new things. It can improve and achieve things on its own, right? I think, like puts it in a different league, right? And so, different league. And so, I think the impact it will end up having will far surpass everything we've seen before. Obviously, with that comes a lot of important things to think and wrestle with, but I definitely think that will end up being the case. Especially if you get the point of where we can achieve superhuman performance on the AI research itself. So, it's the technology that may, there's an open question, but it may be able to achieve a level toward the technology itself can create itself better than it could yesterday. It's like the move, 37 of alpha research or whatever it is, right? It's right, like, you know, when, you know, you're right, when it can do novel, self-directed research. Obviously, for a long time, we will have, hopefully, always humans in the loop and all that stuff. And these are complex questions to talk about. But, yes, I think the underlying technology, you know, I've said this, like, if you watched seeing alpha go start from scratch, be clueless and like become better. Through the course of a day, you know, like, you know, kind of like, you know, really hits you when you see that happen. Even our, like, the VO3 models, if you sample the models when they were like 30% done and 60% done and looked at what they were generating. And you kind of see how it all comes together. It's kind of like, I would say, it's kind of inspiring, a little bit unsettling, right, as a human. So, all of that is true, I think. Well, the interesting thing of the Industrial Revolution, electricity that you mentioned, you can go back to the, again, the agriculture, the first agricultural revolution. There's what's called the Neolithic package or the first agricultural revolution. It wasn't just that the nomads settled down and started planting food. But all this other kinds of technology was born from that and it's including this package. It wasn't in one piece of technology. It's, there's these ripple effects, second and third order effects that happen. Everything from something silly, like silly, profound, like pottery, it can store liquids and food to something we kind of take for granted, but social hierarchies and political hierarchies. Like, early government was formed because it turns out if humans stop moving and have some surplus food, they start coming up with, they get bored and they start coming up with interesting systems, then trade emerges, which turns out to be a really profound thing. And like I said, government, I mean, there's just second and third order effects from that, including that package is incredible. And probably extremely difficult, if you ask one of the people in the Neolithic tribes to predict that, it will be impossible. It's difficult to predict. But all that said, what do you think are some of the early things we might see in the quote unquote AI package? I mean, most of it probably we don't know today, but like, you know, the one thing which we can tangibly start seeing now is, you know, obviously with the coding progress, you got a sense of it. It's going to be so easy to imagine, like thoughts in your head translating that into things that exist, that'll be part of the package, right? Like, it's going to empower almost all of humanity to kind of express themselves. Maybe in the past, you could have expressed with words, but like, you could kind of build things into existence, right? You know, maybe not fully today, we are at the early stages of vibe coding, you know, I've been amazed at what people have put out online with VO3, but it takes a bit of work, right? You have to stitch together a set of prompts, but all this is going to get better. The thing I always think about this is the worst it'll ever be, right? Like at any given moment in time. Yes, it's actually you went there as kind of a first thought, so the exponential increase of access to creativity. Software, creation, are you creating a program, a piece of content to be shared with others, games down the line, all of that, like just becomes infinitely more possible. I think the big thing is that it makes it accessible, it unlocks the cognitive capabilities of the entire 8 billion. No, I agree. Look, think about 40 years ago, maybe in the US, there were five people who could do what you were doing, like go do an interview, you know, you know, but today, think about with YouTube and other products, etc. And I think how many more people are doing it. So I think this is what technology does, right? Like when the internet created blogs, you know, you heard from so many more people. So I think, but with the AI, I think that number won't be in the few hundreds of thousands. You'll be tens of millions of people, maybe even a billion people, like putting out things into the world in a deeper way. Change the landscape of creativity. And it makes a lot of people nervous, like for example, whatever Fox, MSNBC, CNN, or really nervous about this part, like you mean this dude in the suit, you could just do this and YouTube and thousands of others, tens of thousands of other creators can do the same kind of thing. And now you get a podcast from no book LM, that's about five to 10 times better than any podcast other. I'm joking at this time, but maybe not. And that changes you have to evolve because I on the podcasting front, I'm a fan of podcasts, much more than I am a fan of being a host or whatever. If there's great podcasts, there are both a eyes, I'll just stop doing this podcast. I'll listen to that podcast. We have to evolve and you have to change and that makes people really nervous, I think. But it's also really exciting future. The only thing I may say is I do think like in a world in which there are two AI, I think people value and choose just like in chess. You and I would never watch stockfish 10 or whatever an alpha go play against each like it would be boring for us to watch. But Magnus Carlson and Gukesh that game would be much more fascinating to watch. So it's tough to say like one way to say is you'll have a lot more content and so you will be listening to AI generated content because sometimes it's efficient, etc. But the premium experiences you value might be a version of like the human essence wherever it comes through going back to what we talked earlier about watching messy drivel the ball. I don't know one day. I'm sure a machine will do much better than messy. But I don't know whether it would evoke that same emotion in us. So I think that'll be fascinating to see. I think the element of podcasting or audiobooks that is about information gathering that part might be removed or that might be more efficiently and in a compelling way done by AI. But then it'll be just nice to hear human struggle with information contend with the information try to internalize it, combine it with the complexity of our own emotions and consciousness and all that kind of stuff. But if you actually want to find out about a piece of history, you go to Gemini. If you want to see Lex struggle with that history, then you look or other humans you look you look at that. But the point is it's going to change the nature, continue to change the nature of how we discover information how we consume the information how we create the information. The same way the YouTube change everything completely change news and that's something our society is struggling with. Yeah, YouTube look YouTube enabled. I mean, you know this better than anyone else. It's enabled so many creators. There is no doubt in me that like we will enable more filmmakers than that have ever been right here. We're going to empower a lot more people. So I think there is an expansionary aspect of this, which is underestimated, I think. I think it will unleash human creativity in a way that hasn't been seen before. It's tough to internalize. The only way is if you if you brought someone from the 50s or 40s and just put them in front of YouTube, you know, I think it would blow their mind away. Similarly, I think we would get blown away by what's possible in a 10 to 20 year timeframe. Do you think there's a future and how many years out is it that let's say let's put a mark on it 50% of content in a good content. 50% of good content is generated by VO 4 or 5 or 6. You know, I think depends on what it is for. Like, you know, maybe if you look at movies today with CGI, they're a great filmmakers. You know, you still look at like who the directors are and who use it. They're filmmakers who don't use it at all. You value that. There are people who use it incredibly. You know, think about somebody like a James Cameron, like what you would do with these tools in his hands. But I think there'll be a lot more content created, like just like writers today use Google Docs and not think about the fact that they are using a tool like that. Like people will be using the future versions of these things. Like it won't be a big deal at all to them. I've gotten a chance to get to know Darren Arunowski. Well, he's been really leaning in and trying to figure it's fun to watch a genius who came up before any of this was even remotely possible. He created pie, one of my favorite movies and from there just continued to create a really interesting variety of movies. And now he's trying to see how can they I be used to create compelling films. You have people like that. You have people. I've got just no edger folks. They're AI first like door brothers. Both Arunowski and door brothers create at the edge of the over to window society. You know, they push whether it's sexuality or violence is edgy like artists are, but it's still classy. Doesn't cross that line. Whatever that line is, you know, 100th Tom's Center is this line that the only way to find out where the edge where the line is is by crossing it. And I think for artists that's true, that's kind of their purpose sometimes comedians and artists just cross that line. I wonder if you can comment on the weird place that puts Google. Because Google's line is probably different than some of these artists. What's your, how do you think about specific video and flow about like how to allow artists to do crazy shit. But also like the responsibility of like not for it not to be too crazy. It's a great question. Look part of you mentioned Darren. You know, he's a clear visionary, right? Part of the reason we work started working with them early on video is he's one of those people who was able to kind of see that future get inspired by it and kind of showing the way for how creative people can express themselves with it. Look, I think when it comes to allowing artistic free expression is one of the most important values in a society. Right. I think, you know, artists have always been the ones to push, push boundaries, expand the frontiers of thought. And so look, I think I think that's going to be an important value we have. So I think we will provide tools and put it in the hands of artists for them to use and put out their work. Those APIs, I mean, I almost think of that as infrastructure. Just like when you provide electricity to people or something you want them to use it and like you're not thinking about the use cases on top of it. So it's a pain brush. Yeah. And so I think that's how obviously there have to be some things and you know, society needs to decide that a fundamental level what's okay, what's not. We'll be responsible with it. But I do think, you know, it comes to artistic free expression. I think that's one of those values we should work hard to defend. I wonder if you can comment on maybe earlier versions of Gemini were a little bit careful on the kind of things you would be willing to answer. I just want to comment on I was really surprised and pleasantly surprised and enjoy the fact that Gemini 25 pro is a lot less careful in a good sense. Don't ask me why, but I've been doing a lot of research on James Conn and the the SX. So there's a lot of violence there in that history. It's a very violent history. I've also been doing a lot of research on World War One and World War Two. In earlier versions of Gemini were very basically this kind of sense. Are you sure you want to learn about this? And now it's actually very factual objective talks about very difficult parts of human history and does so with nuance and depth. It's been really nice. But there's a line there that I guess Google has kind of walk a wonder if it's also an engineering challenge how to do that at scale across all the weird queries that people ask. What can you just speak to that challenge? How do you allow Gemini to say again, forgive pardon my French crazy shit, but not too crazy. I think one of the good insights here has been as the models are getting more capable. The models are really good at this stuff. I think in some ways maybe a year ago the models were in full lead there. So they would also do stupid things more often. And so you know you're trying to handle those edge cases, but then you make a mistake in how you handle those edge cases and it compounds. But I think with 2.5 what we've particularly found is once the models cross a certain level of intelligence and sophistication. You know they are able to reason through these nuance issues pretty well and I think users really want that right like you want as much access to the raw model as possible. But it's a great area to think about like you know over time. You know we should allow more and more closer access to it. Obviously let people custom prompts if they wanted to and like you know and you know experiment with it etc. I think that's an important direction, but look the first principles we want to think about it is. You know from a scientific standpoint. Like making sure the models and I'm saying scientific in the sense of like how you would approach math or physics or something like that. From first principles, having the models reason about the world being nuanced etc. You know from the ground up is the right way to build these things right not like some subset of humans kind of hard coding things on top of it. So I think it's the direction we've been taking and I think you'll see us continue to push in the direction. Yeah, I actually asked I gave these notes that took extensive notes and I gave them to Gemini and said can you ask a novel question that's not in these notes. And it wrote me Gemini continues to really surprise me really surprise me it's been really beautiful it's an incredible model. The question it's it generated was you meaning Sundar told the world Gemini is turning out 480 trillion tokens a month. What's the most life changing five word sentence hiding in that haystack? That's a Gemini question. But it made me it gave me a sense I don't think you can answer that but it gave me it woke me up to like all of these tokens are providing little aha moments for people across the globe. So that's like learning that those tokens are people are curious they ask a question and they find something out and it truly could be life changing. Oh, you're just like looking no. I had the same feeling what search many many years ago you you know you you definitely. You know this tokens per month is like grown 50 times in the last 12 months is that I care by the way that it is it is it is accurate glad it got it right. But you know that number was 9.7 trillion tokens per month 12 months ago right it's gone gone up to 480 you know it's a 50 x increase. So there's no limit to human curiosity and I think it's it's one of those moments maybe I don't think it is there today but maybe one day there's a five word phrase which says what the actual universe is or something like that and something very meaningful but I don't think we are quite there yet. Do you think the scaling laws are holding strong on. There's a lot of ways to describe the scaling laws for AI but on the pre training on the post training fronts. So the flip side of that do you anticipate AI progress will hit a wall is there a wall. You know it's a cherished micro kitchen conversation once in a while I have it you know like when Demis is visiting or you know if Demis car I Jeff know Sergei bunch of our people like we sit and you know talk about this right and. Look I we see a lot of headroom ahead right I think we've been able to optimize and improve on all France right. Pre training post training test time compute tool use right over time making these more agent take so getting these models to be more general world models in that direction like we are three. You know the physics understanding is dramatically better than what the deal one or something like that was. So you kind of see on all those dimensions I feel you know progress is very obvious to see. And I feel like there is significant headroom more importantly you know fortunate to work with some of the best researchers on the planet right they think. There is more headroom to be had here and so I think we have an exciting trajectory ahead it's tougher to say you know each year I sit and say okay we're going to throw 10 next more compute or the course of next year at it and like will be see progress. Sitting here today I feel like the year ahead will have a lot of progress and do you feel any limitations like that or the bottlenecks. Compute limited data limited idea limited do you feel any of those limitations or is it forcing my head and off France. I think it's computer limited in this sense right like you know we can all part of the reason you've seen us to flash nano flash and pro models. But not an ultra model it's like for each generation we feel like we've been able to get the pro model at like. I don't know 80 90% of ultra capability but ultra would be a lot more like slow and lot more expensive to serve. But what we've been able to do is to go to the next generation and make the next generations pro ask what is the previous generation's ultra but be able to serve it in a way that it's fast and you can use it and so on. So I do think scaling loss of working but it's tough to get at any given time the models we all use the most. This may be like a few months behind the maximum capability we can deliver right because that won't be the fastest easy as to use etc also that's in terms of intelligence it becomes harder and harder to measure. Performance in quotes because you know you can argue generally flash is much more impactful than pro just because of the latency super intelligent already. I mean sometimes like latency is maybe more important intelligence especially when the intelligence is just a little bit less and flash not it's still incredibly smart model yeah. And so you have to now start measuring impact and then. It feels like benchmarks are less and less capable of capturing the intelligence of models the effectiveness of models the usefulness the real world usefulness of models another kitchen question. So lots of folks are talking about a timeline for a GI or ASI artificial super intelligence so a GI loosely defined is basically human expert level it a lot of the main fields of pursuit for humans. And ASI is what a GI becomes presumably quickly by being able to self improve so coming far superior in intelligence across all these disciplines and humans when do you think we'll have a GI is 2030 a possibility. There's one other term we should throw in there I don't know who who used it first maybe Carpati did a GI have you have you heard a GI the artificial jagged intelligence sometimes feels that way right both there are. Progress and you see what they can do and then like you can trivially find they make numeric letters or like you know counting ours and strawberry or something which seems to trip up most models or whatever it is right so. So maybe we should throw that term in there I feel like we are in the age a I face where like dramatic progress something's don't work well but overall you're seeing lots of progress. But if your question is will it happen by 2030 look we constantly move the lion afforded means to be a GI there are moments today you know like sitting in a Vamo in a San Francisco street with all the crowds and the people and kind of work its way through. I see glimpses of it there the car is sometimes kind of impatient trying to work its way using Astra like in Gemini live or seeing you know asking questions about the world what's this skinny building doing in my neighborhood it's a street light not a building you see glimpses that's why I use the word AJI because. Then you see stuff which obviously you know we are far from a GI to so you have both experience simultaneously happening to you I'll answer your question but I'll also throw this almost feel the term doesn't matter what I know is by 2030 there'll be such dramatic progress. We'll be dealing with the consequences of that progress both the positives both the positive externalities and the negative externalities that come with it in a big way by 2030 so that I strongly feel right whatever we may be arguing about the term or maybe Gemini can answer what that moment is in time in 2030. But I think the progress will be dramatic right so that I believe in the AI think it has reached a GI by 2030 I would say we will just fall short of that timeline right so I think it'll take a bit longer it's amazing in the early days of Google deep mine in 2010 they talked about it 20 year time frame to achieve a GI so which is kind of fascinating to see but you know I for me the whole thing seeing what Google brain is. We're doing it in 2012 and when we acquired deep mine in 2014 right close to where we're sitting in 2012 you know Jeff Dean showed the image of and the neural networks could recognize a picture of a cat right and identify it you know this is the early versions of brain right and so you know we all talked about couple decades. Quite get there by 2030. So my senses it's slightly after that but I I would stress it doesn't matter like what that definition is because you will have mind blowing progress on many dimensions maybe AI can create videos we have to figure out as a society how do we we need some system by which we all agree that this is AI generated and we have to disclose it in a certain way because how do you distinguish reality otherwise. Yeah so many interesting things you said so first I'll just look it back at this recent now feels like distant history. With Google brain I mean that was before TensorFlow before TensorFlow was made public and open source so the tooling matters to combine with GitHub ability to share code. Then you have the ideas of attention transformers and the diffusion now and then there might be a new idea. That seems simple in retrospect but will change everything and that could be the post training the inference time innovations and I think Shad Sian tweeted that Google is just one great UI from completely winning the air is meaning like. UI is a huge part of it like how that intelligence. I think Logan Cooper project likes to talk about this right now it's an LLM but it become like one is going to become a system where you're talking about shipping systems versus shipping in the particular model yeah that matters to how the system is. Manifest itself and how it presents itself to the world that really really matters oh hugely so there are simple UI innovations which have changed the world right and. I absolutely think so we will see a lot more progress in the next couple of years is I think AI itself on a self improving track for UI itself like you know today we are like constraining the models the models can't quite express themselves in terms of the UI to two people. But that is like you know if you think about it we've kind of box them in that way. But given these models can code. You know they should be able to write the best interfaces to express their ideas over time right that is incredible idea so the API is already open. So you can you create a really nice agent existing that continues it improves. The way you can be talking to an AI yeah but a lot of that is the interface and then of course the incredible multimodal aspect of the interface that Google has been pushing these models are natively multimodal. They can easily take content from any format put it in any format they can write a good user interface they probably understand your preference is better that over time. Like you know and so all this is like the evolution ahead right and so. That goes back to where we started the conversation I thought like I think there will be dramatic evolution in the years ahead maybe one more kitchen question. This even further ridiculous concept of P doom so the philosophical minded folks in the AI community think about the probability that a GI and then ASI. I my destroy all human civilization I would say my P doom is about 10% do you ever think about this kind of long term threat of ASI and what would your P doom be look for sure look I've both been very excited about AI but I've always felt this technology you know you have to actively think about the risks and work very very hard to. Harness it in a way that it it all works out well on the P doom question look it's you know one surprise you say that's probably another micro kitchen conversation that pops up once in a while right and. Even how powerful the technology is maybe stepping back you know when you're running a large organization if you can kind of align the incentives of the organization you can achieve pretty much anything right like you know if you can get kind of people all marching in towards like a goal in a very focused way in a mission driven way to. I can pretty much achieve anything but it's very tough to organize all of humanity that way but I think if P doom is actually high at some point all of humanity is like aligned in making sure that's not the case right and so will actually make more progress against it I think so the irony is so there is a self modulating aspect there like I think if humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem whatever it is I think we can get there. So because of that you know I think I'm optimistic on the P doom scenarios but that doesn't mean I think the underlying risk is actually pretty high but I'm you know I have a lot of faith and humanity kind of rising up to the to meet that moment that's really well put I mean as the threat becomes more concrete and real humans do really come together and get their share together with the other. The other thing I think people don't often talk about is probability of doom without AI so there's all these other ways that humans can destroy themselves and it's very possible at least I believe so that AI will help us become smarter kinder to each other more efficient it will help more parts of the world flourish where it wouldn't be less resource constrained which is often the source of military conflict intentions and so on. We also have to load into that what's the P doom without AI with the I P doom with the I P doom without AI because it's very possible the AI will be the thing that saves us saves human civilizations from all the other threats I agree with you I think I think it's insightful look I felt like to make progress on some of the toughest problems will be good to have AI like pair helping you right and and like you know so that resonates with me for sure yeah. I was about to break. I know. If no book I'm was the same compared like what I saw today with beam if was compelling in the same kind of way blue my mind it was incredible I didn't think it's possible I didn't my I was like can imagine like the US president the Chinese president being able to do something like beam with the live meat translation working well so they both sitting and talking make progress a bit more. Yeah just for people who took a quick bath break and now we're talking about the demo I did will probably post it somewhere somehow maybe here the I got a chance to experience beam and it was. It's hard to it's hard to describe in words how real it felt with just what is it six cameras incredible it's incredible it's it's one of the toughest products if you can't quite describe it to people even when we show it in slides it's like you don't know what it is you have to kind of experience it on the world leaders front on politics geopolitics there's something really special again with studying World War 2 and how much could have been saved if Chamberlain met Stalin in person and I sometimes also struggle explaining to people articulating why I believe meeting in person for world leaders is powerful it just seems naive to say that but there's something there in person and with beam I felt that same thing and then I'm unable to explain all I kept doing is what like a child does you look real you look real you know and I mean I don't know if that makes meetings more productive or so on but it certainly makes them more. It's the same reason you want to show up to work versus remote sometimes that human connection I don't know what that is it's hard to put into words. There's some there's only beautiful about great teams collaborating on a thing that's that's not captured by the productivity of that team or by whatever on paper. There's some most beautiful moments you experience in life is at work pursuing a difficult thing together for many months. There's nothing like it you're in the trenches and yeah you do form bonds that way for sure and to be able to do that like somewhat remotely in that same personal touch I don't know that's a deeply fulfilling thing I know a lot of people I personally hate meetings because a significant percent of meetings when done poorly are don't serve a clear purpose. So but that's a meeting problem that's not a communication problem if you could improve the communication for the meetings that are useful. It's just incredible so yeah I was blown away by the great engineering behind it and then we get to see what impact that has that's really interesting but just incredible engineering really impressive. No it is and obviously will work out over the years to make it more and more accessible but yeah even on a personal front outside of work meetings you know a grandmother who's far away from our grandchild and being able to you know have that kind of an interaction right all that I think will end up being very mean nothing and substitute being in person you know it's not always possible you know it could be a soldier deployed trying to talk to your loved ones so I think you know so that's what inspires us. When you and I hung out last year and took a walk I remember I don't think we talked about this but I remember you know outside of that seeing dozens of articles written by analysts and experts and so on that. So I should step down because the perception was that Google was definitively losing the a. I race has lost its magic touch and the rapidly evolving technological landscape and now a year later it's crazy you showed this plot of all the things that were shipped over the past year. It's incredible and Gemini Pro is winning across many benchmarks and products as we sit here today so take me through that experience when there's all these articles saying you're the wrong guy to leave Google through this Google's lost is done it's over to today where Google's winning again what were some low points during that time. Look I am a lot strung packed you know obviously like the main bet I made as a CEO is to really you know make sure the company was approaching everything in a AI first way really you know setting ourselves up to develop a GI responsibly right and and make sure we're putting out products which which embodying the company. Which which embodies that things that are very very useful for people so look I I knew even through moments like that last year. You know I had a good sense of what we were building internally right so I'd already made you know many important decisions you know bringing together teams of the caliber of brain and deep mine and setting up cool deep mine. There were things like we made the decision to invest in TPUs 10 years ago so we knew we were scaling up and building big models anytime you're in a situation like that. A few aspects I'm good at tuning out noise right separating signal from noise do you skew but I like have you know you know some amazing like I'm not good at it but I've done it a few times. But sometimes you jump in the ocean it's so choppy but you go down one feet under it's the calmest thing in the entire universe right so there's a version of that right like you know running Google. You know you may as well be coaching Barcelona Real Madrid for like you know you have a bad season so there are aspects to that but you know like look I'm good at tuning out the noise I do watch out for signals you know it's important to separate the signal from the noise so there are good people sometimes making good points outside so you want to listen to it you want to take that feedback and. But you know internally like you know you're making a set of consequential decisions right as leaders you're making a lot of decisions many of them are like in consequential. Like it feels like but over time you learn that most of the decisions you're making on a day to day basis doesn't matter like you have to make them and you're making them just to keep things moving. But you have to make a few consequential decisions right and and we're. Set up the right teams right leaders we had both class researchers we were training Gemini internally there are factors which were for example outside people may not have appreciated I mean TPUs are amazing but we had to ramp up TPUs to. That took time right and and at a scale actually having enough TPUs to get the compute needed. But I could see internally the trajectory we were on. And and be you know I was so excited internally about the possible to me this moment felt like one of the biggest opportunities ahead for us as a company. That the opportunity space ahead or the next decade next 20 years is bigger than what has happened in the past. And I thought we were set up like better than most companies in the world to go realize that vision. I mean you had to make some consequential bold decisions like you mentioned the merger of deep mind and brain. Maybe it's my perspective just knowing humans I'm sure there's a lot of egos involved it's very difficult to merge teams and I'm sure there are some hard decisions to be made can you take me through your process of how you think that you're going to pull the trigger make that decision. Maybe we're some painful points how do you navigate those turbulent waters. Look we were fortunate to have two world class teams but you're right like it's like somebody coming and telling to you take Stanford and MIT right and then put them together and create a great department right and and easier said then done. But we were fortunate in a phenomenal teams both had their strengths you know they were on very differently right like brain was kind of a lot of diverse projects bottoms up and out of it came a lot of. Important research breakthroughs deep mind at the time had a strong vision of how you want to build a GI and so they were pursuing their direction. But I think through those moments luckily tapping into you know Jeff had expressed a desire to be more to go back to more of a scientific individual contributor roots you know you felt like management was taking up too much of his time. And and and Demis naturally I think you know was running deep mine and was a natural choice there. But I think it was you're right you know took us a while to bring the teams together credit to Demis Jeff, Cori all the great people there. They worked super hard to combine the best of both worlds when you set up the team. A few sleepless nights here and there as we put that thing together we were patient in how we did it. So that it works well for the long term right and and some of that in that moment I think yes with things moving fast. I think you definitely felt the pressure. But I think we pulled off that transition well and you know I think I think you know they were obviously doing incredible work and there's a lot more incredible things I had coming from them. Like we talked about you have a very calm even tempered respectful demeanor during that time whether it's the merger or just dealing with the noise. Were there times of frustration brought over like did you have to go a bit more intense on everybody than you usually would probably you know probably here I think I think in the sense that in a was a moment where we were all driving hard but when you're on the trenches working with passion. You're going to have days right you disagree you argue like all that I mean just part of the course of working intensely right and you know at the end of the day all of us are doing what we are doing because the impact it can have we are motivated by it. It's like you know for many of us this has been a long term journey and so it's been super exciting the positive moments far out way the kind of stressful moments just early this year I had a chance to celebrate back to back over two days like you know noble price for Jeff Finton and the next day a noble price for a demos and John jumper you know you work with people like that all that is super inspiring. Is there something like with you where you had to like put your foot down maybe with less. Versus more were like on the CEO and we're making we're doing this to my earlier point about consequential decisions you make there are decisions you make people can disagree pretty vehemently and. But at some point like you make a clear decision and you just ask people to come it right like you know you can disagree but it's time to disagree and come it so that we can get moving and. But it's putting the foot down or you know like you know it's a natural part of what all of us have to do and you know I think you can do that calmly I think you're very firm in the direction you are. Making the decision and I think if you're clear actually people over time respect that right like you know if you can make decisions with clarity I find it very effective in meetings where you're making such decisions to hear everyone out. It's important when you can to hear everyone out sometimes what you're hearing actually influences how you think about and you're resting with it and making a decision sometimes you have a clear conviction and you state so look I. I you know this is how I feel and you know this is my conviction and you kind of placed a bet and you move on other big decisions like that i'm kind of. Intuitively assume the merger was the big one I think that was a very important decision you know for the company to. To meet the moment I think we had to make sure we were we were doing that and doing that well I think there was a consequential decisions there were many other things we set up a AI infrastructure team. Like to really go meet the moment to scale up the compute we needed to and really brought teams from the spread parts of the company kind of created to move forward. You know bringing people like getting people to kind of work together physically both in London with deep mind and what we call gradient canopy which is where the mountain view Google deep mind teams are. But one of my favorite moments is I routinely walk multiple times per week to the gradient canopy building where our top. Researchers are working on the models. Sergey is often there amongst them right looking at just you know looking at. You know getting an update on the models in Laska so all that I think that cultural part of getting the teams together back. With that energy I didn't end up playing a big role to what about the decision to. Recently add AI mode so Google search is the as they say the front page of the Internet it's like a legendary minimalist. Thing with 10 blue links like that's when people think Internet they think that page and now you're starting to mess with that. So the AI mode which is a separate tab and then integrating AI in the results I'm sure there are some battles in meetings on that one look in some ways when mobile came. You know people wanted answers to more questions so we kind of constantly evolving it but you're right this moment you know that evolution. Because the underlying technology is becoming much more capable. You know you can have AI give a lot of context you know but one of our important design goals those when you come to Google search. You're going to get a lot of context but you're going to go and find a lot of things out on the web so that will be true in AI mode in AI or views and so on. I think to our earlier conversation we are still giving you access to links but think of the AI as a layer which is giving you context summary maybe in AI mode you can have a dialogue with it back and forth on your journey. Right and but through it all you're kind of learning what's out there in the world so those core principles don't change but I think AI mode allows us to push the we have our best models there. Right models which are using searches deep to really for every query you're asking kind of fanning out doing multiple searches like kind of assembling that knowledge in a way so you can go and consume what you want to right and and that's how we think about it. I got just to listen to a bunch of Elizabeth Liz read yeah describe this two things stood out to me that you mentioned one thing is what you were talking about is the query fan out. Which I didn't even think about before is the powerful aspect of integrating a bunch of stuff on the web for you in one place so yes it provides that context so that you can decide which page to then go on to the other really really big things big to the earlier. In terms of productivity multiply there were talking about that she mentioned was language so one of the things you don't quite understand is it through AI mode you make for non English speakers you make sort of let's say English language websites accessible by in the reasoning process as you try to figure out what you're looking for of course once you show up to a page you can use a basic translate. But that process of figuring it out if you empathize with a large part of the world that doesn't speak English there like web is much smaller in that original language and so it unlocks again unlocks that huge cognitive capacity there we don't you know you take for granted here with all the bloggers and the journalist writing about AI mode you forget that this now unlocks. Okay, because you know that's really good at translation. No it is I mean at the multi-modality the translation I said to you reason we're dramatically improving tool use like I support that power in the flow of search. I think look I'm super excited with the IO views we've seen the product has gotten much better we measured using all kinds of user metrics so obviously driven strong growth of the product and you know we've been testing AI mode you know it's now in the hands of millions of people and the early metrics are very encouraging so look I'm excited about this next chapter of search. For people we're not thinking through aware of this so there's the template links with AI overview on top that provides a nice summarization you can expand it and you have sources and links links now yeah embedded I believe at least let's say so I actually didn't notice it but there's ads in the I overview also. I don't think there's ads in a mode. When ads in AI mode so no when do you think I mean it's okay we should say that in the 90s I remember the animated gifts banner gifts that take you to some shady websites they have nothing with anything add sense revolutionized advertising is one of the greatest inventions in recent history because it allows us for free to have access to all these kinds of services so ads fuel. So ads fuel a lot of really powerful services and and it's best it's showing you relevant ads but also very importantly in a way that's not super annoying in a class way so. When do you think it's possible to add ads into AI mode and what does that look like from a classic not annoying perspective two things early part of AI mode will obviously focus more on the organic experience to make sure we're getting it. Right I think the fundamental value of ads are it enables access to deploy the services to billions of people. Second is ads are the reason we've always taken ads seriously is we view ads as commercial information but it's still information and so we bring the same quality metrics to it. I think with the AI mode to our earlier conversation about I think AI is so full help us or time figure out you know the best way to do it. I I think given we are giving context around everything we think it'll give us more opportunities to also explain okay here's some commercial information like today as a podcaster you do that certain spots and you probably figure out what's best in your podcast. I think so there are aspects of that but I think you know I think the underlying need of people value commercial information businesses are trying to connect to users all that doesn't change in an AI moment but look we will rethink it you've seen as in YouTube now do a mixture of subscription and ads like obviously. You know we are now introducing subscription offerings across everything and so as part of that. We can optimize the optimization point will end up being a different place as well you see it rejected in the possible future where AI mode completely replaces. The template links plus AI overview. Our current plan is AI mode is going to be there is a separate tab for people who really want to experience that but it's not yet that the level where our main search pages but as features work will keep migrating it to the main page. And so you can view it as a continuum AI mode will offer you the bleeding edge experience but it'll things that work will keep all flowing. To AI overviews in the main main experience and the idea that AI mode will still take you to the web to the human created web yes that's going to be a core design principle for us so really if users decide right they drive this yeah. It's just exciting a little bit scary that I might change the internet is you Google has been dominating with a very specific look and idea of what it means to have the internet and to as you move to AI mode. I mean it's just a different experience I think Liz was talking about I think you've mentioned that you ask more questions you ask longer questions. It's dramatically different types of questions yeah like it actually fuels curiosity like I think is for me I've been asking just a much larger number of questions of this black box machine let's say whatever it is. And and with the AI overview is interesting because I still value the human. I still ultimately want to end up on the human created web. But like you said the context really helps it helps us deliver higher quality referrals right you know where people are like they're much higher likelihood of finding what they're looking for they're exploring the curious that intent is getting satisfied more so that's what all our metrics show it makes the humans that create the web nervous the journalist to get nervous they're already been nervous like we mentioned CNN is nervous because of podcasts. It makes people nervous look I think news and journalism will play an important role you know in the future we're pretty committed to it right and so I think making sure that ecosystem in fact I think we'll be able to differentiate ourselves as a company over time because of our commitment there so it's it's something I think you know I definitely value a lot and and as we are designing will continue prioritizing approaches. I'm sure for the people who want they can have a fine tuned AI model this clickbait hit pieces that will replace current journalism that's a shot of journalism forgive me but I I find that if you're looking for really strong criticism of things that Gemini is very good at providing that. Absolutely it's better than anything the for now I mean people concerned that there would be bias that's introduced that has the a assistance become more and more powerful there's incentive from sponsors to roll in and try to control the output of the AI models but for now the objective criticism that's provided is way better than journalism of course the argument is the journalists are still valuable but then I don't know the crowdsurge journalism that we get on the level of journalism. Open Internet is also very very powerful I feel like they're all super important things I think it's good that you get a lot of crowdsourced information coming in. But I feel like there is real value for high quality journalism right and and I think these are all complimentary I think like I viewed as I find myself constantly seeking out also like try to find objective reporting on on things that I think are good. Yes too and and sometimes you get more context from the crowd fund sources you read online but I think both end up playing a super important role. So there's a spoken a little about about this demos talked about this is sort of the slice of the web that will increasingly become about providing information for agents so we can think about is like two layers of the web. For humans one is for agents do you see the AI agents do you see the one is for AI agents growing over time do you see there's still being long term five 10 years value for the human created human created for the purpose of human consumption web or will it all be agents in the end. In today. Like not everyone does but you know you go to a you go to big retail store you love walking dial you love shopping. Or grocery store. Thinking at food etc we're also online shopping and they're delivering right so both are complimentary and like that's true for restaurants etc so I do feel like over time websites will also get better for humans. They will be better design AI might actually design them better for humans so I expect the web to get a lot richer and more interesting and better to use. At the same time I think there'll be an agentic web which is also making a lot of progress and you have to solve the business value and the incentives to make that work well right like for people to participate in it. But I think both will coexist and obviously the agents may not need the same not may not they won't need the same design and the UI paradigm such humans need to interact with but I think both will both will be there. I have to ask you about chrome I have to say for me personally Google Chrome is probably. I don't know I'd like to see where I would rank it but in this temptation this is not a recently bias although it might be a little bit but I think it's up there top three maybe the number one piece of software for me of all time so it's incredible it's really incredible the browser is our window to the web and chrome really continue for many years but even initially to push the innovation on that front when it was still and it continues to challenge it continues to make it more. Performance so efficient just innovate constantly and the the the chromium aspect of it anyway. You were one of the pioneers of chrome pushing for it when it was an insane idea probably one of the ideas that was criticized and doubted and so on so can you tell me the story of what it took to push for chrome what was your vision. Look it was a such a dynamic time in around 2004 2005 with Ajax the web suddenly becoming dynamic in a matter of few months flicker Gmail Google maps all kind of came into existence right like the fact that you have an interactive dynamic web the web was evolving from simple text pages simple HTML. To rich dynamic applications but at the same time you could see the browser was never meant for that world right like JavaScript execution was super slow. You know the browser was far away from being an operating system for that rich modern web which was coming into coming into place so that's the opportunity we saw like you know it's an amazing early team. I still remember the day we got a shell on WebKit running and how fast it was. You know we had the clear vision for building a browser like we wanted to bring core OS principles into the browser right like so we built a second browser sandbox each tab was its own not these things are common now but at the time like it was pretty unique. We found an amazing team in our who's done mark with the leader who built the V8 the JavaScript PM which at the time was 25 times faster than any other JavaScript PM out there and by the way you're right we open source of all and you know and put it in chromium to but we really thought the web could work much better. You know much faster and you could be much safer browsing the web and the name chrome came was because we literally felt people were like the chrome of the browser was getting clunkier we wanted to minimize it and so that was the origins of the project definitely obviously. I'm highly biased person here talking about chrome but it's the most fun I've had building a product from the ground up and you know it was an extraordinary team had my co-founders in the project with terrific so definite phone memories. Before people don't know Sundar is probably fair to say you're the reason we have chrome yes I know there's a lot of incredible engineers but pushing for inside a company that probably was opposing it because it's the crazy idea because as everybody probably knows it's incredibly difficult to build a browser. Look I Eric was the CEO at that time I think it was less that he was supposed to it he kind of first and you know what a crazy thing it is to go build a browser and so he definitely was like this is you know there was a crazy aspect to actually wanting to go build a browser but he was very supportive you know everyone the founders were I think once we started you know building something and we could use it and see how much better from then on like you know you're right. You're really tinkering with the product and making it better it came to life pretty fast what wisdom do you draw from that from pushing through on a crazy idea in the early days that ends up being revolutionary what for future crazy ideas like it. I mean this is something Larry and Sir gave articulated clearly I really internal internalized this early on which is you know they're whole feeling around working on moonshots like as a way when you work on something very ambitious first of all it attracts the best people right so that's an advantage you get number two. Because it's so ambitious you don't have others working on something crazy so you pretty much have the path to your cells right it's like way more self driving number three it is even if you end up quite not a completion what you set out to do and you end up doing 60 80% of it you end up being a terrific success so so you know that's advice I would give people right I think like you know it's just aiming for big ideas has all these advantages and and it's risky. But it also has all these advantages which people I don't think fully internalize I mean you mentioned one of the craziest biggest moonshots which is way more it's one of when I first saw over a decade ago away more vehicle. Go sell driving car vehicle. It was for me it was an aha moment for robotics it made me fall in love with robotics even more than before gave me a glimpse of the future so it's incredible truly grateful for that project for what it symbolizes but it's also a crazy moonshot. It's for for a long time way most been just like you mentioned with scuba diving just not listening to anybody just calmly improving the system better better more testing just expanding the operation domain more and more first I'll congrats on 10 million paid robot taxi rides what lessons do you take from way more about like the perseverance the persistence on that project. I'll really proud of the progress we have had with Paymo one of things I think we were very committed to you know the final 20% can look like you made we always say right the first 80% is easy the final 20% takes 80% of the time I think we are definitely where we're working through that face with Paymo but I was aware of that so but you know we knew we were at that stage. We knew we were the technology gap between while there were many people many other self driving companies we knew the technology gap was there. In fact right at the moment when others were doubting way more is when. Made the decision to invest more in way more right because so so in some ways it's counter intuitive but I think look we've always been a deep technology company and like. You know way more is a version of kind of building a a i robot that works well and so we get attracted to problems like that the caliber of the teams there you know phenomenal teams and so I know you follow the space super closely you know talking to someone who knows the space well. But it was very obvious it's going to get there and you know there's still more work to do but we you know it's a good example where we always prioritized. Being ambitious and safety at the same time right and and equally committed to both and pushed hard and you know could be more thrilled with how it's working how much people love love the experience and it this year is definitely we've scaled up a lot and we'll continue scaling up in 26. That said the competition is heating up you've been friendly with Elon. Even though technical is a competitor but you've been friendly with a lot of text CEOs in that way just show respect towards them and so on what do you think about the robot taxi efforts that Tesla is doing do you see this competition what do you think do you like the competition. We are one of the earliest and biggest backers of space X has Google right so you know thrilled with what space X is doing and fortunate to be investors as a company there right and and like we don't compete with Tesla directly we are not making cars etc right we are building. And L45 autonomy building a Vemo driver which is general purpose and can be used in many settings there obviously working on making Tesla self driving to just assume it's a de facto that Elon would succeed in whatever he does so like you know that that is not something I question so but I think we are so far from these spaces are such vast spaces like I think think about. Transportation the opportunity space the way more drivers are general purpose technology we can apply in many situations so you have a vast green space in all future scenarios I see Tesla doing well and you know very more doing well like we mentioned with the new electric package I think it's very possible that in the quote unquote AI package when the history is written autonomous vehicles some driving cars. It's like the big thing that changes everything imagine over a period of a decade or two just the complete transition for manual driven to autonomous in ways we went we might not predict it might change the way we move about the world completely so that you know the possibility of that and then the second or third order effects as you're seeing now with Tesla very possibly you would see some. Internally with alphabet maybe way more maybe some of the jamming on robotics stuff it might lead you into the other domains of robotics we should remember that way most of robot. It just happens to be out of four wheels so you you said the next big thing. We can also throw that into the package the big aha moment might be in the space of robotics. That would look like. Demis and the Google deep point team is very focused on Gemini robotics right so we are definitely building. The underlying models well so we have a lot of investments there and I think we're also pretty cutting edge in our research there so we are definitely driving that direction. We obviously are thinking about applications in robotics will will kind of work seriously we are partnering with a few companies today. But it's an area I would say stay tuned we are you know we are yet to fully articulate our plans outside. But it's an area we are definitely committed to driving a lot of progress but I think AI ends up driving that massive progress in robotics the field has been held back. For a while I mean hardware has made extraordinary progress the software had been the challenge but you know with AI now and and and the generalized models we are building. You know we are building these models getting them to work in the real world in a safe way in a generalized way is the frontier we are pushing pretty hard on well it's really necessary that the models and the different teams integrated to where all of them are pushing towards one world model. That's being built so from all these different angles multimodal. You're ultimately trying to get Gemini. So the same thing that would make AI mode really effective in answering your questions which requires a kind of world model is the same kind of thing that would help a robot be useful in the physical world so everything is aligned. That is what makes this moment so unique because running a company for the first time you can do one investment in a very deep horizontal way on top of which you can like drive multiple businesses forward right and you know and that's that's effectively what we are doing in Google and alphabet right. It's all coming together like it was planned ahead of time but it's not of course it's all distributed. I mean if Gmail and sheets and all these other incredible services I can sing Gmail praises for years I mean just just revolutionized email but the moment you start to integrate AI Gemini into Gmail. I mean that's the other thing speaking of productivity multiplier people complain about email but that changed everything. Email like the invention of email change everything and it's been ripe there's been a few folks trying to revolutionize email some of them on top of Gmail but that's like ripe for innovation not just spam filtering but you are you the demo the really nice demo of person nice responses right. And at first I was like at first I felt really bad about that but then I realized that there's nothing wrong to feel bad about because you the example you gave is when a friend asks you know you went to whatever hiking location. Do you have any advice and they just search us through all your information to give them good advice and then you put the cherry on top maybe some love or whatever camaraderie but the informational aspect. The knowledge transfer does for you I think it would be important moments like it should be like today. If you write a card in your own handwriting and send it to someone that's a special thing similarly there'll be a time to your friends maybe a friend wrote and said he's not doing well or something you know those are moments you want to save your times for writing something reaching out. But you know like saying give me all the details of the trip you took you know to me makes a lot of sense for AI assistant to help you right and so I think both are important but I think I think I'm excited about that. Yeah I think ultimately it gives more time for us humans to do the things we humans find meaningful and I think it scares a lot of people because we're going to have to ask ourselves the hard question of like what do we find meaningful and I'm sure there's answers. I mean it's the old question of the meaning meaning of existence as you you have to try to figure that out that might be ultimately parenting or being creative and some domains of art or writing and it challenges to like you know it's a good question of to ask yourself like in my life what is the thing that brings me most joy and fulfillment and if I'm able to actually focus more time on that that's really powerful. I think that's the you know that's the holy grave if you get this right I think it allows more people to find that I have to ask you on the programming front AI is getting really good at programming. Gemini but the agent it can just the Ellen Lamb has been incredible so a lot of programmers are really worried that their jobs they will lose their jobs how where should they be and how should they adjust so they can be thriving in this new world or. More and more code is written by AI I think a few things looking at Google. You know we've given way stats around like. You know 30% of code now uses like AI generated suggestions or whatever it is but the most important metric and we carefully measure this like. How much as our engineering velocity increased as a company due to AI right and it's like tough to measure and we can rigorously try to measure it under estimates are at that number is now at 10% right like now across the company we've accomplished a 10% engineering velocity increase using AI. But we plan to hire engineers more engineers next year right so you because the opportunity space of what we can do is expanding to right and so. I think hopefully you know for at least the near to mid term for many engineers it frees up more and more of the. I you know even an engineering encoding. There are aspects which are so much fun you're designing your architecting you're solving a problem there's a lot of. Grant work you know which all goes hand in hand but it hopefully takes a lot of that away makes it even more fun to code frees you up more time to. Create problems all brains from it you fellow colleagues and so on right so that's that's the opportunity there. And second I think like you know it'll attract it'll put the creative power in more people's hands which means people create more that means there'll be more engineers doing more things. So it's tough to fully predict but you know I think in general in this moment. It feels like you know people adopt these tools and be better programmers. Like there are more people playing chess now than ever before right so. You know it feels positive that way to me at least speaking from within a Google context. So I would. You know talk to them about it I still I just know anecdotally a lot of great programmers. Are generating a lot of code so their productivity they're not always using all the code just you know it's there's still a lot of editing but like. Even for me it's the programming is a side thing I think I'm like 5x more productive I don't I think that's even for a large code base is touching a lot of users like Google's does. I'm imagining like very soon that productivity should be going up a little more big unlock will be as we make the agent the capabilities much more robust right I think that's what unlocks that next big wave. I think the 10% is like a massive number like you know tomorrow like I showed up and said like yeah you can improve like a large organizations productivity by 10% when you have tens of thousands of engineers that's a phenomenal number. And you know that's different than what others cite as statistics saying like you know like this percentage of code is now written by AI I'm talking more about like overall actual productivity actual productivity right engineering productivity which is two different things. And which is the more important metric and but I think it'll get better right and like you know I think there's no engineer who tomorrow if you magically became 2x more productive. Just going to create more things you're going to create more value added things and so I think they you'll you find more satisfaction in your job right so. And there's a lot of aspects I mean the actual Google code base might just improve because it'll become more standardized more easier for people to move about the code base because AI will help with that and therefore that will also allow the AI to understand the entire code base better which makes the engineering aspect so I've been using cursor a lot yeah as a way to program with Gemini and other models is like. It one of its powerful things it's aware of the entire code base and that allows you to ask questions of it allows the agents to move about that code base in a really powerful way that's a huge amount think about like you know migrations refactoring old code base is actually yeah I mean think about like you know once we can do all this in a much better more robust way than where we are today. I think in the end everything will be written in JavaScript and running Chrome I think it's all going to that direction I mean just for fun Google has legendary code coding interviews like rigorous interviews for the engineers how can you comment on how that has changed in the air of AI it's just such a weird. Like you know the whiteboard interview I assume is not allowed to have some prompts such a good question look I do think you know we're making sure you know we'll introduce at least one round of in person interviews for people just to make sure the fundamentals are there I think they'll end up being important person equally important skill look if you can use these tools to generate better code like you know I think I think that's a good thing. That's an asset and so you know I think so overall I think it's a massive positive vibe coding engineer do you recommend people students interested in programming still get an education in computer science college education what do you think I do we if you have a passion for computer science I would you know computer science is obviously a lot more than programming alone so I would I still don't think I would change what you personally. I think I will horizontally allow impact every field it's pretty tough to predict in what ways. So any education in which you're learning good first principles thinking I think it's good education you've revolutionized web browsing you've revolutionized a lot of things over the years Android change the game it's an incredible operating system we could talk for hours about it. What is the future of Android look like is it is a possible it becomes more and more AI centric especially now the throw into the mix Android XR with the be able to do augmented reality mix reality and virtual reality in the physical world. The best innovations in computing have come when you're through a paradigm I would change right like you know when when with we and then the graphically interface and then with multi touch in the context of mobile voice later on. Similarly I feel like you know AR is that next paradigm I think it was held back both the system integration challenges making good AR is very very hard the second thing is you need AI to actually kind of otherwise the iOS to complicate for you to have a natural seamless I owe to that paradigm AI ends up being super important and so. This is why project Astra ends up being super critical for that Android XR world but it is I think when you use glasses and you know always been amazed like at the how useful these things are going to be so I look I think it's a real opportunity for Android. I think XR is one way will kind of really come to life but I think there's an opportunity to reading the mobile OS to right I think we've been kind of living in this paradigm of like apps and shortcuts all that won't go away but again like if you're trying to get stuff done I don't operate in system level you know it needs to be more agent takes so that you can kind of describe what you want to do or like it proactively understands what you're trying to do learns from how. So you're doing things over and over again I'm kind of adapting to you all that is kind of like the unlock we need to go and do with the basic efficient minimalist UI I've got a chance to try the glasses and they're incredible it's the little stuff it's hard to put into words but no latency it just works even that little map demo where you look down and you look up and there's a very smooth transition between the two. And useful very small amount of useful information is shown to you enough not to distract from the world outside but enough to provide a bit of context when you get it and some of that. In order to bring that into reality of the solve a lot of the OS problems to make sure it works when you're integrating the AI into the whole thing so every everything you do launches an agent that answers some basic question. Good moonshot you know I think we are you know but it's. Much closer to reality than other moonshots you know we expect to have. Classes in the hands of developers later this year and you know consumer science next year so it's an exciting time yeah well extremely well executed beam all the stuff you know because I sometimes you don't know. Like somebody commented on a top comment on one of the demos of beam they said this will either be killed off in five weeks or revolutionize all meetings in five years and there's very much Google tries so many things and sometimes sadly kills off very promising projects but because there's so many other things focus on I use I use so many Google products Google voice I still use I'm so glad that's not being killed off that's still alive thank you. Whoever is defending that because it's awesome and it's great they keep innovating I just want to list off just as a big thank you so search obviously Google revolutionized chrome and all these can be multi hour conversations Gmail have been singing Gmail praises forever maps incredible technological innovation revolutionizing mapping Android like we talked about YouTube like we talked about add sense Google translate for the academic mind the Google scale. It's incredible when with the book and also the scanning of the books so making all the world's knowledge accessible even with that knowledge is a kind of niche thing which Google scholar is and then obviously with deep mind with alpha zero alpha fall alpha evolve I could talk forever about alpha evolve that's mind blowing all of that released and as part of that set of things you released in this year when those brilliant articles were written about Google is done and like we talked about pioneering self driving cars and quantum computing which could be another thing that is low key is scuba diving it's way to changing the world forever so another pot has slash micro kitchen question if you build a GI. What kind of question would you ask it what would you what would you want to talk about definitively Google is created a GI that can basically answer any question what topic are you going to work where's it where you going secret question maybe it's proactive by then should tell me a few things I should know but I think if I were to ask it I think it'll help us understand ourselves much better in a way that will surprise us I think and so maybe that's you already see people do it with the products and so but you know in a GI context I think that'll be pretty powerful at a personal level or general human nature at a personal level like you speak to a GI I think I think you know there is some chance it'll kind of understand you you know I think that's a good thing about it. In a very deep way I think you know in a profound way that's a possibility I think there is also the obvious thing of like maybe it helps us understand the universe better in a way that expands the frontiers of our understanding of the world that is something super exciting but look I really don't know I think you know I haven't had access to something that powerful yet but I think those are all possibilities. I think on the personal level asking questions about yourself could a sequence of questions like that about what makes me happy I think it would be very surprised to learn the those kind of the a sequence of questions and answers that might explore some profound truths in a way that sometimes art reveals to us great books reveal to us great conversations with love the ones reveal things that are obvious and retrospect but are nice when they're said but for me number one question is about how many alien civilizations are 100% I mean it's going to be a first question number one how many living in dead alien civilizations maybe a bunch of follow ups like how close are they are they dangerous if there's no alien civilizations why or if there's no advanced aliens of those issues but bacteria like life everywhere why what is the barrier preventing you from getting to that is it because that there's that when you get sufficiently intelligent you end up destroying ourselves because you need competition or you should develop an advanced civilization and when you have competitions going to lead to military conflict and conflict eventually kills everybody I'm going to have that kind of an answer to the foamy paradox yeah exactly and like have a real discussion about it. I'm not sure if it's a I'm realizing now with your answer is a more productive answer because I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that information but maybe speaks to the general human curiosity that let's talk about the world is really curious and making the world's information accessible allows our curiosity be satiated some with AI even more we can be more more curious and learn more about the world about ourselves and so doing I was wonder if I don't know if you can comment on the world. Like it's possible to measure the not the GDP productivity increase like we talked about but maybe whatever that increases the the breadth and depth of human knowledge that Google has unlocked with Google search and now with AI mode with Gemini is a difficult thing to measure many years ago it was a he was a mighty study they just estimated the impact of Google search and they basically said it's the equivalent to on a per person basis it's few thousands of dollars per year per person right like is the value that got created per year right and and but it's yeah it's tough to capture these things right like you kind of take it take it for granted as these things come and the frontier keeps moving but you know how do you measure the value of something like alpha fold over time right and and and so on so it's and also the increasing quality of life when you learn more I have to say like with some of the programming I do done by AI for some reason I'm more excited to program yeah and so the same with knowledge with discovering things about the world it makes you more excited to be alive it makes you more curious to and it keeps the more curious you are more exciting it is to live and experience the world and it's very hard to I don't know if that makes you more productive it probably not nearly as much as it makes you happy to be alive and that's a hard thing to measure the quality of life increases some of these things do as they add continues to get better and better at everything that humans do what you think is the biggest thing that makes us humans special look I think stuffed art in the essence of humanity there's something about you know the consciousness we have what makes us uniquely human maybe the lines will blur over time and and it's tough to articulate but I hope hopefully you know we live in the world where if you make resources more plentiful and make the world lesser of a zero sum game over time right and which it's not but you know in a resource constraint environment people perceive it to be right and and and so I hope the values of what makes us uniquely human empathy kindness all that surfaces more is the aspirational hope I have yeah it multiplies the compassion but also curiosity just the the banter the debates will have about the meaning of it all and I also think the scientific domains all the incredible worth the deep mind is doing I think we'll still continue to to play to explore scientific questions mathematical questions physics questions even as I get better and better helping us solve some questions sometimes the question itself is the really difficult thing both the right new questions to ask and the answers to them and and the self discovery process which it will drive I think you are early work with both co scientist and alpha evolve just a super exciting to see what gives you hope about the future of human civilization of course I'm a teacher of human civilization. I've always been an optimist and you know I look at now if you were to say you take the journey of human civilization it's been you know we've relentlessly made the world better right in many ways at any given moment in time there are big issues to work through it may look but you know always ask myself the question would you have been born now or any other time in the past I most often not most often almost always would rather be born now right you know and so that's the extraordinary thing the human civilization is accomplished right and like you know and we've kind of constantly made the world a better place and so something tells me as humanity we always rise collectively to drive the frontier forward so I expected to be no different in the future I agree with you totally I'm truly grateful to be alive in this moment and I'm also really excited for the future and the work you and the incredible teams here are doing is one of the big reasons I'm excited for the future so thank you thank you for all the cool products you built and please don't kill Google voice. Thank you so much. We won't yeah thank you for talking today this was incredible real pleasure appreciate it. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sundar Pachai to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description or at Lex Friedman dot com slash sponsors shortly before this conversation I got a chance to get a couple of demos that frankly blew my mind the engineering was really impressive the first demo was Google Beam and the second demo was the XR glasses and some of it was caught on video so I thought I would include here some of those video clips. Hey Lex my name is Andrew I lead the Google Beam team and we're going to be excited to show you a demo we're going to show you I think a glimpse of something new so that's the idea a way to connect a way to feel present from anywhere with anybody you care about. Here's Google Beam this is a development platform that we've built so there's a prototype here of Google Beam there's one right down the hallway I'm going to go down and turn that on in a second we're going to experience it together we'll be back in the same room wonderful. Whoa okay here we are okay this is real already wow this is Google Beam we're trying to make it feel like you and I could be anywhere in the world but when these magic windows open we're back together I see you exactly the same where you see me it's almost like we're sitting at the table sharing a table together I could. You'll learn from you talk to you share a meal with you get to know you so you can feel the depth of this wow so for people who probably can't even imagine what this looks like there's a there's a 3d version it looks real you look real it looks really you it looks like you're coming out of the screen. We quickly believe once we're in the game that we're just together we settle into it you're naturally attuned to seeing the world like this and you just get used to seeing people this way but literally from anywhere in the world with the magic screen this is incredible. Wow so I saw demos of this but they're they don't come close to the experience of this I think one of the top YouTube comments and one of the demos I saw was like why would I want to hide definition I haven't tried to turn off the camera but this actually is this feels like the camera has been turned off and we're just in the same room together this is really compelling. That's right I know it's kind of late in the day to so I brought you a snack just in case you're a little bit hungry but um so what can you push it farther and it just becomes a lot. Let's try to float it between rooms you know I kind of fade it from my room and then and then you see my hand the depth of my hand. Of course yeah I feel like you tried this try to give me a high five and there's almost a sensation of feeling touched almost feel yes because you're so attuned to you know that should be a high five it's feeling like you could connect with something that way so it's kind of a magical experience. Oh this is really nice how much does it cost. I think we've got a lot of companies testing it we just announced that we're going to be bringing it to offices soon as a set of products we've got some company helping us build these screens but eventually I think this will be an almost every screen. There's nothing I'm not worrying anything while I'm worrying to see what time to clarify I ain't more in close this is not as a GI but outside of that cool and the audio is really good and you can see me in the same three dimensional way. Yeah the audio spatialized so if I'm talking from here of course it sounds like I'm talking from here you know if I move you the other side of the room. So these little subtle cues these really matter to bring people together all the non-verbal all the emotion the things that are lost today here it is we put it back into the system you pulled this off holy shit they pulled it off and integrate into this I saw the translation also right this is the kind of lunch and things let me show you a couple kind of cool things let's do a little bit of work together maybe we could. Parting one of your latest. So you know it's you and I work together so of course we're in the same room but with the superpower I can bring other things in here with me and it's nice you know it's like we could. We could sit together we could watch something we could work we've shared meals as a team together in the system but once you do the presence has been to bring some other superpowers to it and so you could do review code together. Yeah yeah exactly I've got some slides I'm working on you know maybe you could help me with this keep your eyes on me for a second all slide back into the center I didn't really move but the system just kind of puts us in the right spot and knows where we need to move. So you just turn to your laptop the system moves you and it does the overlay automatically. It kind of warps the room to put things in the spot that they need to be in everything has a place in the room everything has a sense of presence or spatial consistency and that kind of makes it feel like we're together with us another thing. I should also say you're not just three dimensional it feels like you're leaning like out of the screen you're like coming out of the screen. You're not just in that world three dimensional yeah exactly. Holy crap. Move back to center. Okay. Let me tell you how this works you probably already have the premise of it but there's two things two really hard things that we put together. One is a AI video model so there's a set of cameras you asked kind of about those earlier there's six color cameras just like what we have today. Taking video streams and feeding them into our AI model and turning that into a 3d video of you and I it's effectively a light field. It's kind of an interactive 3d video you can see from any perspective that's transmitted over to the second thing and that's a light field display and it's happening by directly I see you and you see me both in our light field displays these are effectively flat televisions or flat displays but they have the sense of dimensionality depth sizes correct you can see shadows and lighting are correct and everything's correct from your vantage point so if you move around ever so slightly and I hold still you see a different perspective. You see kind of things that were included become reveal you see shadows that you know moving the way they should remember all of that's computed and generated using our AI video model for you it's based on your eye position where does the right scene need to be placed in this light field display just to feel this real time no latency I'm not seeing you weren't freezing up at all. No no I hope not I think it's you and I together real time that's what you need for real communication and the quality. This is awesome. Realistic is it possible to do three people like is that going to move that way also. Yeah let me let me kind of show you so if she enters the room with us you can see her you can see me and if we had more people you eventually lose a sense of presence you kind of shrink people down you lose a sense of scale so think of it as the window fits a certain number of people if you want to fit a big group of people you want you know the board room or the big room you need like a much wider window if you want to see you know just grandma and the kids you can do smaller windows so everybody has a seat at the table or everybody has a sense of where they belong and there's kind of the sense of presence that's obeyed if you have too many people you kind of go back to like 2D metaphors that were used to people in tiles placed anywhere for the image I'm seeing did you have to get scanned. I mean I see you without being scared so it's just so much easier if you don't have to wear anything you don't have to preach and you just do it the way it's supposed to happen without anybody having to learn anything or putting anything on. I thought you had to solve the the scanning problem but here you don't it's just cameras it's just a video. Yeah we're not trying to kind of make an approximation of you because everything you do every day matters you know I cut myself anything I put on a pin all the little kind of you know aspects of you those just happen we don't have the time to scan or kind of capture those or dress avatars we kind of appear as we appear and so all that's transmitted truthfully at top of it. Hi Dr. Good morning. Nice to meet you. So as Max mentioned, we start with the foundation of great glasses and things stylish lightweight wearable let me say how can build great technology experiences on top of that. One of the core tenants of the Android XR platform this idea of a multimodal conversational device see what you see what you hear so you've got a camera you've got speakers multiple microphones for speaker isolation. I'll give you a chance to try these yourself. Yeah, sorry I woke it up there. Whoa yeah so the first thing you see is a super simple straightforward home screen. So you probably see the time the weather calendar appointments there this is designed to be sort of your one stop shop for quick glanceable information throughout the day one something that's easy to get what you need and then go back to what you're doing so you can imagine you're turning on the display getting that quick glance and then continuing on your way you can be fully conversational this way you can ask questions for example about the paintings you can interrupt you can ask follow up questions and as I mentioned before if you want to at any time pause you just have there on the right. Gemini how much is this painting cost? The painting is called the Bridge of Belief Elite 1875 by Armand Guilme. It appears to be a friend and it would be impossible to know it's cost without finding the seller. Okay so this is fake I understand why do humans pay so much money for paintings? People pay a lot for paintings because of their artistic merit the artist is paying a sense of severity and pretty appreciation. So a few more things I want to show you just for a sake of time. You go ahead and long press on the site again to just look at them there you go. Did you catch Google I go last week by nature? Yes so you might have seen on stage the Google Maps experience very briefly. I wanted to give you a chance to get a sense of what that feels like today. You can imagine you're walking down the street if you look up like you're walking straight ahead you get quick turn by turn directions. So you have a sense of what the next turn is like. Nice. Oh that's so intuitive. Sometimes you need that quick sense of what you have the right way. Sometimes. So let's see if you're coming out of the sun. Every time. You can just plant it down at your feet. We have it set up to translate from Russian to English. I think I get to wear the glasses and you speak to me if you remind. I can speak Russian. Hi friend how are you doing? I'm doing well how are you doing? Time to swear, time to say the appropriate things. I see it transcribed in real time and so obviously you know based on the different languages and sequence of subjects and verbs. There's a slight delay sometimes but it's really just like subtitles for the real world. Thank you for this. Alright back to me. Hopefully watching videos of me having my mind blown like the apes in 2001 space honestly playing with a monolith was somewhat interesting. Like I said I was very impressed and now I thought if it's okay I could make a few additional comments about the episode in just in general. In this conversation with Sundar Pachai I discussed the concept of the Neolithic package which is the set of innovations that came along with the first agriculture revolution. About 12,000 years ago which included the formation of social hierarchies the early primitive forms of government labor specialization domestication of plants and animals. Early forms of trade large scale corporations of humans like that required to build yes the pyramids and temples like go back to the tape. I think this may be the right way to actually talk about the inventions that changed human history not just as a single invention but as a kind of network of innovations and transformations that came along with it. And the productivity multiplier framework that I mentioned in the episode I think is a nice way to try to concretize the impact of each of these inventions under consideration. And we have to remember that each node in the network of the sort of fast follow on inventions is in itself a productivity multiplier some are additive some are multiplicative. So in some sense the size of the network in the package is the thing that matters when you're trying to rank the impact of inventions on human history. The easy picks for the period of biggest transformation at least in sort of modern day discourse is the industrial revolution or even in the 20th century the computer or the internet. I think it's because it's easiest to intuit for modern day humans the impact the exponential impact of those technologies but recently I suppose this changes week to week. But I have been doing a lot of reading on ancient human history so recently my pick for the number one invention would have to be the first agricultural revolution the newolithic package that led to the formation of human civilizations. That's what enable the scaling of the collective intelligence machine of humanity and for us to become the early bootloader for the next 10,000 years of technological progress which yes includes AI and the tech that builds on top of AI. And of course it could be argued that the word invention doesn't properly apply to the agriculture revolution I think actually you all know harari argues that it wasn't the humans who were the inventors but a handful of plant species namely wheat rice and potatoes. This is strictly a fair perspective but I'm having fun like I said with this discussion. Here I just think of the entire earth as a system that continuously transforms and amusing the term invention in that context asking the question of when was the biggest leap on the log scale plot of human progress. Will AI agsi eventually take the number one spot on this ranking I think it has a very good chance to do so do again to the size of the network of inventions that will come along with it. I think we discussed in this podcast the kind of things that would be included in the so called AI package but I think there's a lot more possibilities including a discussion previous podcasts and many briefs podcasts including with the. I'm a day talking on the biological innovation side the size progress side in this podcast I think we talk about something that I'm particularly excited about in the near term which is. Unlocking the cognitive capacity the entire landscape of brains that is the human species. Making it more accessible through education and through machine translation making information knowledge and the rapid learning and innovation process accessible to more humans to the entire eight billion if you will so I do think language or machine translation apply to all the different methods that we use on the internet to discover knowledge is a big unlock. But there are a lot of other stuff in the so called AI package like discuss with Dario curing all major human diseases he really focuses on that in the machines of love and grace essay I think there will be huge leaps in productivity for human programmers and semi autonomous human programmer so humans in the loop but most of the programming is done by AI agents and then moving that towards a super human AI researcher that's doing the research. That develops and programs the AI system in itself I think there would be huge transformative effects from autonomous vehicles these are the things that we maybe don't immediately understand or we understand from an economics perspective but there will be a point when AI systems are able to interpret understand interact with the human world the sufficient degree to where many of the manually controlled human in the loop system. So the world human in loop systems rely on become fully autonomous I think mobility such a big part of human civilization that there will be effects on that they're not just economic but our social culture and so on. And there's a lot more things I could talk about for a long time so obviously the integration utilization of AI in the creation of art film music. I think the digitalization and automating basic functions of government and then integrating AI into that process thereby decreasing corruption and cost and increasing transparency and efficiency I think we as humans individual humans will continue to transition further and further into cyborgs sort of there's already a AI in the loop of the human condition. And that will become increasingly so as the AI becomes more powerful the thing I'm obviously really excited about is major breakthroughs in science and not just in the medical front but on physics fundamental physics which would then lead to energy breakthroughs increasing the chance that we become we actually become a Kardas have type one civilization and then enabling us and so doing to do a stellar exploration of space and colonization of space. I think they're also in the near term much like with the industrial revolution that led to rapid specialization of skills of expertise there might be a great sort of despecialization so as the AI system become super human experts in particular fields there might be greater and greater value to being the integrator of a eyes. For humans to be sort of generalists and so the great value of the human mind will come from the generalists not the specialist that's a real possibility that that changes the way we are about the world that we want to know a little bit of a lot of things and move about the world in that way that can have when passing a certain threshold a complete shift and who we are as a collective intelligence as a as a human species. Also as an aside when thinking about the invention that was the greatest in human history again for a bit of fun we have to remember that all of them build on top of each other and so we need to look at the delta the step change on the I would say impossible to perfectly measure plot of exponential human progress really we can go back to the entire history of life on earth and a previous podcast guest Nick Lane does a great job of this in his book life ascending listing. He's 10 major inventions throughout the evolution of life on earth like DNA photosynthesis complex cells sex movement site all those kinds of things I forget the full list that's on there but I think that's so far from the human experience that my tuition about let's say productivity multipliers of those particular invention completely breaks down and a different framework is needed to understand the impact of these and. The origin of life on earth or even the big bang itself of course is the OG invention that set the stage for all the rest of it and there are probably many more turtles under that which are yet to be discovered so anyway we live in interesting times fellow humans I do believe the set of positive trajectories for humanity outnumber the set of negative trajectory. So let's not mess this up and now let me leave you with some words from French philosopher John de la Breuière out of difficulties grow miracles. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
