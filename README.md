# AI-Explains-What-They-Meant-An-Emotion-Insight-Mining-Framework-for-Podcasts
AI analyzes podcasts to extract meaning, emotion, and speaker intent.
This project applies advanced text mining techniques to analyze podcast transcriptsâ€”extracting core meanings, emotional sentiment, and speaker intent. The pipeline is designed to generate short, AI-narrated summaries that reveal what notable figures *really meant* during conversations. It supports use cases such as quote-based analysis, sentiment visualization, and topic modeling, with an end goal of enabling insightful and accessible video content creation for platforms like YouTube.

## Project Objectives

- Extract speaker intent and emotional tone from raw podcast transcripts.
- Perform quote-based analysis to highlight significant statements.
- Visualize sentiment progression using sentiment graphs.
- Apply unsupervised topic modeling to uncover recurring themes and interdisciplinary links.
- Generate short, AI-ready textual summaries for content narration.

## Challenges & Roadblocks

- **Whisper model** lacks built-in diarization: built custom segment management logic.
- **Memory limits** when processing large audio files.
- **Topic modeling** required multiple iterations for coherence and interpretability.
- **YouTube scraping** involved handling rate limits and metadata cleanup.
